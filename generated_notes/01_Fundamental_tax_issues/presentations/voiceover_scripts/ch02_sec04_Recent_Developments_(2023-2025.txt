OECD Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax: From 2024-2025, large multinationals (revenue >EUR 750 million) face 15% global minimum tax through Income Inclusion Rules (IIR), Undertaxed Profits Rules (UTPR), and Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT). This eliminates benefits of preferential rates below 15%. Transfer Pricing Updates: OECD issued 2024 guidance on financial transactions including intra-group financing, guarantees, hedging, and cash pooling. Energy Transition Incentives: Enhanced tax credits for carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen production, and renewable infrastructure (e.g., US Inflation Reduction Act 2022). EU CBAM: Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (2023-2026 phase-in) imposes carbon pricing on imports, affecting energy-intensive industries.

# Licence and Concession Regimes

## 1. Core Framework and Legal Principles

### 1.1 Introduction to Extractive Industry Fiscal Regimes

Licence and concession regimes represent the two primary legal frameworks through which sovereign states grant rights to extract natural resources (petroleum, minerals, natural gas) to private entities. These regimes fundamentally determine the fiscal relationship between the state and the investor, affecting tax treatment, ownership rights, and profit distribution.

The choice between a licence and concession regime has profound implications for:
- **Resource ownership** during and after extraction
- **Tax and royalty structure** applicable to operations
- **Cost recovery mechanisms** available to operators
- **Ring-fencing provisions** and loss utilization
- **Decommissioning obligations** and security requirements

### 1.2 Statutory Basis and Legal Framework

#### 1.2.1 Constitutional and Legislative Foundation

Most extractive industry regimes are founded on constitutional provisions asserting state ownership of natural resources. Key legislative instruments include:

- **Petroleum Acts/Mining Acts**: Primary legislation establishing the legal basis for resource extraction
- **Finance Acts**: Annual provisions setting tax rates, allowances, and fiscal terms
- **Model Contracts**: Standard form agreements (Production Sharing Contracts, Concession Agreements)
- **Regulations and Guidelines**: Secondary legislation detailing operational requirements

**Example Jurisdictions:**
- UK: **Petroleum Act 1998**, Finance Acts (annual), **Oil Taxation Act 1975** (historically, largely repealed)
- Norway: **Petroleum Tax Act**, **Petroleum Activities Act**
- Ghana: **Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act 2016**
- Indonesia: **Oil and Gas Law No. 22/2001** (PSC regime)

#### 1.2.2 International Law Considerations

The **principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources** (UN General Assembly Resolution 1803, 1962) provides states with the right to regulate extraction and taxation of resources within their territory. However, this sovereignty is balanced against:

- **Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)**: Protecting investor rights, providing stabilization
- **International arbitration mechanisms**: ICSID, ICC arbitration for disputes
- **Stabilization clauses**: Freezing fiscal terms at contract signature

### 1.3 Definitions and Fundamental Concepts

#### 1.3.1 Concession Regime

**Definition**: A legal framework where the state grants an investor the right to explore for and extract natural resources, with **ownership of resources passing to the investor at the point of extraction** (the "wellhead" or "pithead"). The investor assumes all exploration and development risks.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Resource ownership transfers upon extraction
- Government revenue primarily through **royalties and corporate income tax**
- Investor bears full cost risk
- Traditional "tax-royalty" system
- Common in: UK, Norway, USA, Canada, Australia

#### 1.3.2 Licence Regime (Production Sharing Contract - PSC)

**Definition**: A contractual arrangement where the state retains ownership of resources throughout, and grants the investor a **licence to extract resources in exchange for a share of production**. The investor receives cost recovery and a share of "profit oil/gas."

**Key Characteristics:**
- State retains resource ownership
- Government revenue through **profit oil share and income tax** (or in lieu of tax)
- Contractor recovers costs from "cost oil/gas" (typically 50-80% of production)
- Common in: Indonesia, Malaysia, Angola, Iraq, many developing nations

#### 1.3.3 Hybrid and Alternative Regimes

**Risk Service Contracts (RSCs)**: Contractor paid a fee for services, no share of production (e.g., Mexico historically, some Iranian contracts).

**Joint Ventures**: State participation through national oil companies (e.g., Nigeria NNPC, Saudi Aramco partnerships).

### 1.4 Comparison of Regime Types

| **Feature** | **Concession Regime** | **Licence/PSC Regime** |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Resource Ownership** | Transfers at extraction point | Remains with state throughout |
| **Risk Bearing** | 100% contractor | 100% contractor (typically) |
| **Revenue Mechanism** | Royalty + Corporate Tax | Profit oil share + Tax (or in-lieu) |
| **Cost Recovery** | Through tax deductions | Explicit cost oil mechanism |
| **Accounting** | Contractor's books (IFRS/GAAP) | PSC accounting (ringfenced) |
| **Fiscal Stability** | Subject to legislative changes | Contractual stabilization common |
| **Ring-fencing** | Field or license-level | Contract-level |
| **Transfer Pricing** | Full TP rules apply | Limited to cost recovery audits |
| **Depreciation** | Tax code provisions | PSC-defined uplifts |

## 2. Technical Rules and Tax Provisions

### 2.1 Concession Regime - Tax Structure

#### 2.1.1 Royalties

Royalties represent the state's compensation for resource depletion. They are:

- **Ad valorem**: Percentage of gross revenue (typically 10-20%)
- **Specific**: Fixed amount per unit ($/barrel, $/tonne)
- **Sliding scale**: Rate varies with production volume, price, or profitability

**Tax Treatment:**
- **Deductible** for income tax purposes in most jurisdictions
- Calculated on **gross revenue** before costs
- Timing: Usually payable monthly or quarterly

**Example Rates (2024-2025):**
- UK: 0% (abolished 2003, replaced with supplementary charge mechanisms)
- Norway: 0% (reliance on high corporate tax + special petroleum tax)
- Ghana: 5% of gross revenue (petroleum)
- Alberta, Canada: Variable 5-40% (sliding scale with price)

#### 2.1.2 Corporate Income Tax (CIT)

Standard corporate tax applies to taxable profits from extractive activities, with modifications:

**Special Rates:**
- **Norway**: 78% total (22% general CIT + 56% special petroleum tax)
- **UK**: 30% ring fence corporation tax (for profits above £250,000; 19% for profits below £50,000 from April 2023)
- **Australia**: 30% standard CIT (plus PRRT for petroleum)

**Ring-Fencing Rules:**

Ring-fencing prevents losses or expenditures from extractive activities being offset against other income:

1. **Field-level ring-fencing**: Each field is separate taxable unit (Norway post-2005 for new fields)
2. **License-level ring-fencing**: Losses within license area can offset (UK Continental Shelf)
3. **Activity-level ring-fencing**: All E&P activities pooled, but separate from other business (UK onshore, Australia PRRT)

**Loss Utilization:**
- **Carry forward**: Typically indefinite with uplift (Norway: 11.5% annual uplift on unused losses)
- **Carry back**: Limited or not available in most jurisdictions
- **Group relief**: Often restricted for ring-fenced trades

#### 2.1.3 Supplementary Charges and Resource Rent Taxes

**Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) - UK (Historical):**
- 75% rate on field profits (abolished 2016 for all fields, legacy obligations only)
- Field-by-field basis with complex allowances (oil allowance, safeguard)

**Supplementary Charge - UK (Current):**
- 10% supplementary charge on ring-fence profits (rate since January 2016)
- Energy Profits Levy (windfall tax): 38% from 1 November 2024 (increased from 35%, effective January 2023)
- Combined headline rate: 30% + 10% + 38% = **78%** on North Sea profits (as of November 2024)

**Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) - Australia:**
- 40% rate on project-level "excess profits"
- Calculation: Gross revenue minus deductible costs minus PRRT allowance
- Costs uplifted at GDP factor + 15% if not recovered
- Transfer restrictions prevent grouping of projects

#### 2.1.4 Capital Allowances and Deductions

**Immediate Expensing vs. Depreciation:**

| **Jurisdiction** | **Treatment** | **Rate/Method** |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **UK (pre-2023)** | 100% First Year Allowance | Immediate deduction |
| **UK (2023-2026)** | Full Expensing (temporary) | 100% for plant & machinery |
| **Norway** | Straight-line depreciation | 16.67% p.a. (6 years) for production assets |
| **USA** | Bonus depreciation / Cost depletion | 100% bonus (phasing out); 15% cost depletion |
| **Australia** | Immediate deduction (PRRT) | Uplifted if not recovered |

**Pre-production Expenditure:**
- **Exploration costs**: Typically immediately deductible
- **Development costs**: May be capitalized and depreciated or immediately deducted
- **Appraisal costs**: Treatment varies by jurisdiction

#### 2.1.5 Decommissioning and Abandonment

**Tax Relief:**
- Costs of decommissioning are **deductible** when incurred
- **Taxable cessation receipts** may arise on license termination (UK)

**Security Requirements:**
- Financial guarantees for decommissioning obligations (UK: Site-Specific Decommissioning Plans)
- Tax relief provided through normal trading deductions

### 2.2 Licence/PSC Regime - Tax Structure

#### 2.2.1 Production Sharing Mechanism

The PSC waterfall typically follows this structure:

```
Gross Production (100%)
    ↓
Less: Royalty (if applicable) → to Government
    ↓
= Available Production
    ↓
Split:
├─ Cost Oil/Gas (50-80%) → Contractor cost recovery
│   (subject to annual limit as % of production)
└─ Profit Oil/Gas (remaining) → Split between Government and Contractor
        ├─ Government Share (60-85%)
        └─ Contractor Share (15-40%)
```

**Cost Recovery Ceiling:**
- Limits annual cost recovery to percentage of total production (e.g., 50%, 70%, 80%)
- Unrecovered costs carried forward (usually with **uplift**)

**Uplift on Unrecovered Costs:**
- Compensation for time value of money
- Typical rates: 5-10% per annum (compound)
- Applied to costs not recovered due to ceiling

#### 2.2.2 Cost Oil Mechanics and Eligible Costs

**Recoverable Costs:**
1. **Operating costs (Opex)**: Fully recoverable in year incurred
2. **Capital costs (Capex)**: Depreciated over PSC-defined period (e.g., 5 years straight-line)
3. **Exploration costs**: May be 100% recoverable or subject to limits
4. **Indirect costs**: Head office allocations (usually limited to 1-2.5% of operating costs)

**Non-Recoverable Costs:**
- Income tax paid by contractor
- Interest on external borrowing (in some PSCs)
- Penalties and fines
- Above-ground costs unrelated to operations

**Ring-Fencing in PSCs:**
- Each PSC contract is **separate fiscal entity**
- No cross-contract cost recovery
- No consolidation for tax purposes

#### 2.2.3 Profit Oil Split and Determining Factors

Profit oil sharing percentages typically determined by:

**1. R-Factor (Cumulative Revenue/Cumulative Cost):**

| **R-Factor Range** | **Government Share** | **Contractor Share** |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| < 1.0 | 60% | 40% |
| 1.0 - 1.5 | 70% | 30% |
| 1.5 - 2.5 | 80% | 20% |
| > 2.5 | 85% | 15% |

**2. Production Volume (Daily or Cumulative):**

Higher production → Higher government take

**3. Price Sliding Scale:**

Higher oil/gas prices → Higher government take

**4. Fixed Contractual Split:**

Negotiated at contract signature, no variation (less common in modern PSCs)

#### 2.2.4 Income Tax Treatment Under PSCs

**Approaches:**

1. **Tax paid by contractor** (e.g., Indonesia pre-2017 PSCs):
   - Contractor pays income tax on contractor's profit oil share
   - Tax is non-recoverable cost

2. **Tax in lieu arrangement** (e.g., many African PSCs):
   - Government's profit oil share deemed to include contractor's tax
   - Contractor receives tax exemption
   - Government "tax take" is its profit oil share

3. **Hybrid**:
   - Reduced tax rate with government profit oil
   - Example: Angola (Government 60% profit oil + contractor pays 30% CIT on its 40% share)

**Transfer Pricing and PSCs:**
- Cost recovery subject to **arm's length principle**
- Audits focus on:
  - Service fees to affiliates
  - Management charges
  - Equipment rentals
  - Technical services

### 2.3 Recent Developments (2023-2025)

#### 2.3.1 UK Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax)

Introduced May 2022, modified through 2024:
- **Rate**: 35% (January 2023 - October 2024), increased to 38% from 1 November 2024
- **Combined rate**: 30% ring fence CT + 10% supplementary charge + 38% EPL = **78%** total (as of November 2024)
- **Investment Allowance**: Originally 80% of capital expenditure; main allowance abolished for expenditure on/after 1 November 2024
- **Decarbonisation Investment Allowance**: Increased to 66% to maintain cash value following rate increase
- **Sunset clause**: 31 March 2030 (extended from 31 March 2028)
- **Impact**: Reduced investment appetite, field decommissioning accelerated

#### 2.3.2 Norway Resource Rent Considerations

- **Uplift rate maintained**: 11.5% on unutilized costs (annual)
- **Offshore wind taxation**: New regime for offshore wind (22% CIT, no special tax)
- **CO2 storage**: Tax incentives for carbon capture and storage projects

#### 2.3.3 Global Minimum Tax (Pillar Two) Impact

**OECD BEPS 2.0 GloBE Rules:**
- 15% global minimum tax rate effective 2024-2025
- **Extractive industries**: Specific considerations
  - Royalties may be "creditable" qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes
  - Ring-fencing creates jurisdictional complexities
  - PSC structures: Treatment of government profit share unclear

**Implications:**
- High-tax jurisdictions (Norway 78%, UK 78%): No Pillar Two impact
- Low-tax PSC jurisdictions: Potential top-up tax if "profit oil" not treated as covered tax

---

## 3. Analytical Depth and Cross-Border Issues

### 3.1 Interaction Between Fiscal Elements

The **effective government take** (EGT) represents total government revenue as percentage of project value:

**Formula:**
```
EGT = (Royalty + Income Tax + Supplementary Charges + Government Profit Share + State Participation) / Gross Revenue
```

**Progressive vs. Regressive Systems:**

- **Progressive**: Government take increases with profitability (R-factor PSCs, resource rent taxes)
- **Regressive**: Government take decreases with profitability (high fixed royalties)

**Example Comparison (at $80/barrel oil):**

| **Element** | **UK Concession** | **Typical PSC** |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Royalty | 0% | 10% |
| Corporate Tax | 30% | 0% (in-lieu) |
| Supplementary Charge | 10% | - |
| Energy Profits Levy | 38% | - |
| Government Profit Share | - | 55% |
| **Effective Government Take** | **78%** | **68%** |

### 3.2 Cross-Border and Transfer Pricing Implications

#### 3.2.1 Thin Capitalization and Interest Deductibility

**Concession Regimes:**
- Subject to domestic thin capitalization rules (e.g., UK 30% EBITDA limit under corporate interest restriction rules)
- Interest restriction on related-party debt
- OECD BEPS Action 4: Earnings stripping rules

**PSC Regimes:**
- Interest often **non-recoverable** cost
- Encourages equity financing
- Less transfer pricing risk on financing

#### 3.2.2 Treaty Considerations

**Withholding Taxes:**
- Dividends from extractive subsidiaries: Treaty rates apply (often 0-15%)
- Interest and royalties: May be subject to higher WHT in extractive context
- Technical service fees: Potential PE/services PE issues

**Permanent Establishment (PE):**
- Extractive activities typically create PE (OECD Model Art 5(2)(f) - natural resources extraction site)
- Service rigs: 6-12 month threshold in many treaties
- Fiscally transparent entities: Attribution of profits issues

**Treaty Shopping Concerns:**
- Use of intermediate holding companies (Netherlands, Luxembourg historically)
- Principal Purpose Test (PPT) under MLI: Prevents abuse
- Limitation on Benefits (LOB): US treaties

### 3.3 Anti-Avoidance Provisions

#### 3.3.1 General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR)

Applicable to extractive transactions:
- **UK GAAR**: Applies to ring-fence trades, targets abusive arrangements
- **Norway**: Specific anti-avoidance for petroleum sector (burden shifting)
- **Australia**: Part IVA general anti-avoidance + PRRT-specific provisions

**Common Targets:**
- Artificial loss creation through excessive interest
- Inflated service fees to affiliates
- Timing mismatches in cost recovery

#### 3.3.2 Transfer Pricing Audits in Extractive Sector

**High-Risk Areas:**
1. **Procurement services**: Inflated costs from related suppliers
2. **Technical and management fees**: Arm's length analysis required
3. **Rig and equipment rentals**: Comparable uncontrolled prices
4. **Sale of production**: Commodity pricing, quality adjustments

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Master file and local file (OECD BEPS Action 13)
- Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR)
- PSC cost recovery audits: Annual certification requirements

### 3.4 Compliance and Reporting Requirements

#### 3.4.1 Concession Regimes

- **Annual tax returns**: Standard corporate filings with ring-fence schedules
- **Monthly/quarterly royalty returns**: Production-based calculations
- **Supplementary charge returns**: UK-specific (SA900 forms)
- **Production reports**: Regulatory body filings (volumes, fields, reserves)

#### 3.4.2 PSC Regimes

- **Annual cost recovery statements**: Detailed cost classifications
- **Quarterly production reports**: Government entitlement calculations
- **Audit of costs**: Annual or bi-annual cost recovery audits by government
- **Transfer pricing documentation**: For related-party costs
- **Local content compliance**: Reporting on local procurement and employment

#### 3.4.3 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)

Voluntary disclosure framework requiring:
- Payment-by-project reporting
- Government revenue reconciliation
- Public disclosure of contracts (some jurisdictions)

**Impact on Compliance:**
- Increased transparency requirements
- Public scrutiny of fiscal terms
- Contract renegotiation pressures

## 4. Application Methodology and Decision Framework

### 4.1 Step-by-Step Analysis Approach

When analyzing a licence or concession scenario, apply this methodology:

**Step 1: Identify the Regime Type**
- Review governing legislation and contract
- Determine if concession (ownership transfer) or licence/PSC (production sharing)
- Identify applicable tax statutes and rates

**Step 2: Map Revenue and Cost Flows**
- Calculate gross revenue (production × realized price)
- Identify all costs: opex, capex, exploration, decommissioning
- Classify costs by recoverability (PSC) or deductibility (concession)

**Step 3: Apply Fiscal Elements in Sequence**
```
For Concession:
1. Calculate royalty (if applicable) on gross revenue
2. Determine taxable profit: Revenue - Royalty - Deductible costs
3. Apply capital allowances and loss relief
4. Calculate CIT at applicable rate
5. Calculate supplementary charges (if applicable)
6. Determine net contractor position

For PSC:
1. Deduct royalty from gross production (if applicable)
2. Calculate cost recovery: Min(Eligible costs, Cost oil ceiling)
3. Identify unrecovered costs and apply uplift
4. Calculate profit oil: Available production - Cost oil
5. Split profit oil per contract terms (government vs. contractor)
6. Apply income tax (if not in-lieu arrangement)
7. Determine net contractor entitlement
```

**Step 4: Consider Cross-Border Elements**
- Identify treaty applicability and WHT rates
- Assess transfer pricing on related-party transactions
- Evaluate thin capitalization impacts
- Consider permanent establishment issues

**Step 5: Check Anti-Avoidance and Compliance**
- Review arrangements for GAAR/SAAR applicability
- Ensure transfer pricing documentation
- Confirm compliance with local content and reporting requirements

### 4.2 Decision Trees

#### 4.2.1 Regime Selection Decision Tree

```
START: Evaluate Investment in Extractive Project
    |
    ├─ Is resource ownership important to investor?
    │   ├─ YES → Prefer CONCESSION regime
    │   └─ NO → PSC acceptable
    |
    ├─ What is government's risk appetite?
    │   ├─ Low (wants certainty) → PSC with profit oil/tax in-lieu
    │   └─ High (wants upside) → Concession with high CIT + resource rent tax
    |
    ├─ Cost recovery timing preference?
    │   ├─ Explicit, contractual → PSC regime
    │   └─ Tax code-driven → Concession regime
    |
    ├─ Fiscal stability priority?
    │   ├─ High → PSC with stabilization clause
    │   └─ Moderate → Concession (subject to legislative change)
    |
    └─ DECISION → Negotiate terms under preferred regime
```

#### 4.2.2 Cost Recoverability Assessment (PSC)

```
Cost Incurred
    |
    ├─ Is it operating cost?
    │   ├─ YES → Immediately recoverable (subject to ceiling)
    │   └─ NO → Proceed to next test
    |
    ├─ Is it capital cost directly related to petroleum operations?
    │   ├─ YES → Recoverable per depreciation schedule (e.g., 5 years)
    │   └─ NO → Proceed to next test
    |
    ├─ Is it exploration cost?
    │   ├─ YES → Check PSC terms (may be limited or fully recoverable)
    │   └─ NO → Proceed to next test
    |
    ├─ Is it indirect/head office cost?
    │   ├─ YES → Limited recovery (typically 1-2.5% cap)
    │   └─ NO → Likely non-recoverable
    |
    └─ Non-Recoverable → Examples: income tax, financing costs, fines
```

## 5. Worked Examples

### Example 1: UK Concession Regime - North Sea Field Taxation (2024)

**Fact Pattern:**

OilCo UK Ltd operates the "Brent Delta" field on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) under a traditional concession regime. For the fiscal year ended 31 December 2024:

- Gross oil production: 2,000,000 barrels
- Average realized price: £70 per barrel
- Operating costs: £40,000,000
- Capital expenditure (new production facilities): £50,000,000 (qualifies for Full Expensing)
- Decommissioning costs incurred: £5,000,000
- Previous year trading loss (ring-fence): £15,000,000 (no uplift available)

**Applicable Tax Rules:**
- Ring-fence corporation tax: 30%
- Supplementary charge: 10%
- Energy Profits Levy: 38% (rate from 1 November 2024)
- Full Expensing: 100% first-year allowance for qualifying capital expenditure
- Decarbonisation Investment Allowance: 66% of qualifying capital expenditure against Energy Profits Levy

**Required:** Calculate the total tax liability and effective tax rate for 2024.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Revenue**
```
Gross Revenue = 2,000,000 barrels × £70/barrel = £140,000,000
```

**Step 2: Calculate Taxable Profit (before loss relief and capital allowances)**
```
Gross Revenue:                           £140,000,000
Less: Operating costs:                   (£40,000,000)
Less: Decommissioning costs:             (£5,000,000)
                                         _______________
Profit before capital allowances:        £95,000,000
```

**Step 3: Apply Capital Allowances (Full Expensing)**
```
Capital expenditure:                     £50,000,000
Full Expensing relief (100%):            £50,000,000

Profit after capital allowances:         £95,000,000 - £50,000,000 = £45,000,000
```

**Step 4: Apply Loss Relief**
```
Profit after capital allowances:         £45,000,000
Less: Prior year ring-fence loss:        (£15,000,000)
                                         _______________
Ring-fence taxable profit:               £30,000,000
```

**Step 5: Calculate Ring-Fence Corporation Tax (30%)**
```
Ring-fence CT = £30,000,000 × 30% = £9,000,000
```

**Step 6: Calculate Supplementary Charge (10%)**

Supplementary charge is calculated on the same profit base:
```
Supplementary Charge base:               £30,000,000
Rate:                                    10%
Supplementary Charge:                    £3,000,000
```

**Step 7: Calculate Energy Profits Levy (38%)**

EPL includes a Decarbonisation Investment Allowance (66% of qualifying capital expenditure):
```
EPL profit base:                         £45,000,000 (before loss relief)
Less: Prior year loss:                   (£15,000,000)
                                         _______________
                                         £30,000,000
Less: Decarbonisation Allowance (66% × £50m): (£33,000,000)
                                         _______________
EPL taxable profit:                      £0 (cannot be negative)

Energy Profits Levy:                     £0
```

**Note:** The Decarbonisation Investment Allowance of £33m exceeds the profit base, so no EPL is payable. The excess allowance (£33m - £30m = £3m) cannot be carried forward under EPL rules (it's lost).

**Step 8: Total Tax Liability**
```
Ring-fence Corporation Tax:              £9,000,000
Supplementary Charge:                    £3,000,000
Energy Profits Levy:                     £0
                                         _______________
TOTAL TAX LIABILITY:                     £12,000,000
```

**Step 9: Effective Tax Rate**
```
Effective Tax Rate = £12,000,000 / £95,000,000 (profit before capital allowances) = 12.63%

OR

Effective Tax Rate = £12,000,000 / £45,000,000 (profit after capital allowances, before loss relief) = 26.67%
```

**Analysis:**
The effective tax rate of 12.63% (on pre-capex profit) is significantly lower than the headline combined rate of 78% (30% + 10% + 38%) due to:
1. Full Expensing providing immediate 100% capital allowance
2. Decarbonisation Investment Allowance under EPL (66% super-deduction)
3. Utilization of prior year losses

This demonstrates the UK's policy to incentivize continued investment and decarbonization in UKCS despite high headline rates.

### Example 2: Production Sharing Contract (PSC) - Contractor Entitlement Calculation

**Fact Pattern:**

PetroGlobal Corp has a PSC with the Government of Newland for the "Alpha Block" offshore development. The PSC terms for Year 3 of production (2024) are:

**Production:**
- Gross crude oil production: 5,000,000 barrels
- Realized price: $85 per barrel

**PSC Fiscal Terms:**
- Royalty: 10% of gross production (paid in kind to Government)
- Cost recovery ceiling: 60% of available production (after royalty)
- Profit oil split (based on R-Factor):
  - R < 1.5: Government 65%, Contractor 35%
  - R ≥ 1.5: Government 75%, Contractor 25%
- Income tax: Paid by contractor at 30% on contractor's profit oil share (not recoverable)
- Depreciation for cost recovery: Capital costs amortized straight-line over 5 years

**Costs Incurred in Year 3:**
- Operating costs: $120,000,000
- Development capital expenditure (Year 3): $80,000,000
- Exploration costs (successful): $20,000,000

**Historical Position (Years 1-2):**
- Total historical costs incurred: $350,000,000
- Total historical cost recovery: $180,000,000
- Unrecovered costs at start of Year 3: $170,000,000 (with 5% annual uplift)

**Required:**
(a) Calculate the contractor's net entitlement in barrels and $ value for Year 3
(b) Determine the R-Factor and applicable profit oil split
(c) Calculate the income tax liability

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Revenue and Royalty**
```
Gross Production (barrels):               5,000,000
Realized price ($/bbl):                   $85
Gross Revenue:                            $425,000,000

Royalty (10%):                            500,000 barrels
Royalty ($ value):                        $42,500,000

Available Production (after royalty):     4,500,000 barrels
Available Production ($ value):           $382,500,000
```

**Step 2: Calculate Recoverable Costs for Year 3**

**Operating Costs (immediately recoverable):**
```
Operating costs:                          $120,000,000
```

**Capital Costs (Year 3):**
```
Development capex:                        $80,000,000
Depreciation period:                      5 years
Year 3 depreciation:                      $80,000,000 / 5 = $16,000,000
```

**Exploration Costs (assuming 100% recoverable in year incurred):**
```
Exploration:                              $20,000,000
```

**Unrecovered Costs from Prior Years (with Uplift):**
```
Unrecovered balance (start Year 3):      $170,000,000
Uplift (5%):                              $8,500,000
Uplifted unrecovered costs:               $178,500,000
```

**Total Cost Recovery Claim (Year 3):**
```
Operating costs:                          $120,000,000
Capital depreciation (Year 3):            $16,000,000
Exploration:                              $20,000,000
Unrecovered costs (uplifted):             $178,500,000
                                          _______________
Total cost recovery claim:                $334,500,000
```

**Step 3: Apply Cost Recovery Ceiling**
```
Cost recovery ceiling (60% of available production):
= 60% × $382,500,000 = $229,500,000

Cost recovery claim:                      $334,500,000
Cost recovery ceiling:                    $229,500,000

Actual Cost Recovery (Year 3):            $229,500,000 (limited by ceiling)
```

**Step 4: Calculate Unrecovered Costs Carried Forward**
```
Cost recovery claim:                      $334,500,000
Less: Actual recovery:                    ($229,500,000)
                                          _______________
Unrecovered costs (end Year 3):           $105,000,000

Plus: Unamortized capital (Year 3):       $80,000,000 - $16,000,000 = $64,000,000
                                          _______________
Total unrecovered costs to carry forward: $169,000,000
```

**Step 5: Calculate Profit Oil**
```
Available Production:                     $382,500,000
Less: Cost Oil (recovery):                ($229,500,000)
                                          _______________
Profit Oil:                               $153,000,000

Profit Oil (barrels):                     $153,000,000 / $85 = 1,800,000 barrels
```

**Step 6: Determine R-Factor and Profit Oil Split**

**R-Factor Calculation:**
```
R-Factor = Cumulative Revenue / Cumulative Costs

Cumulative Revenue (Years 1-3):
Assuming previous years + Year 3 = [historical] + $425,000,000
For this example, assume: $700,000,000 cumulative

Cumulative Costs (Years 1-3):
Historical costs: $350,000,000
Year 3 costs: $120,000,000 + $80,000,000 + $20,000,000 = $220,000,000
Total: $570,000,000

R-Factor = $700,000,000 / $570,000,000 = 1.228

Since R-Factor (1.228) < 1.5:
- Government share: 65%
- Contractor share: 35%
```

**Step 7: Calculate Contractor's Profit Oil Entitlement**
```
Profit Oil:                               $153,000,000 (1,800,000 barrels)
Contractor share (35%):                   $53,550,000 (630,000 barrels)
Government share (65%):                   $99,450,000 (1,170,000 barrels)
```

**Step 8: Calculate Total Contractor Entitlement (Cost Oil + Profit Oil)**
```
Cost oil:                                 $229,500,000 (2,700,000 barrels)
Profit oil:                               $53,550,000 (630,000 barrels)
                                          _______________
TOTAL CONTRACTOR ENTITLEMENT:             $283,050,000 (3,330,000 barrels)
```

**Step 9: Calculate Income Tax Liability**

Tax is payable on contractor's profit oil share only:
```
Taxable income (profit oil):              $53,550,000
Income tax rate:                          30%
Income Tax Liability:                     $16,065,000
```

**Step 10: Net Contractor Position (After Tax)**
```
Contractor entitlement:                   $283,050,000
Less: Income tax:                         ($16,065,000)
                                          _______________
NET CONTRACTOR POSITION:                  $266,985,000
```

**Summary:**

| **Item** | **Barrels** | **$ Value** | **% of Production** |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Gross Production | 5,000,000 | $425,000,000 | 100% |
| Government Royalty | 500,000 | $42,500,000 | 10% |
| Contractor Cost Oil | 2,700,000 | $229,500,000 | 54% (of available) |
| Government Profit Share | 1,170,000 | $99,450,000 | 23.4% |
| Contractor Profit Share | 630,000 | $53,550,000 | 12.6% |
| **Contractor Total (pre-tax)** | **3,330,000** | **$283,050,000** | **66.6%** |
| Contractor Income Tax | - | ($16,065,000) | - |
| **Contractor Net** | **3,330,000** | **$266,985,000** | - |

**Effective Government Take:**
```
Government Revenue = Royalty + Govt Profit Share + Income Tax
= $42,500,000 + $99,450,000 + $16,065,000 = $158,015,000

Effective Government Take = $158,015,000 / $425,000,000 = 37.18%
```

This relatively moderate government take reflects:
- Low R-Factor (early production phase)
- Significant cost recovery
- Contractor still recovering historical costs

### Example 3: Hybrid Analysis - Concession vs. PSC Regime Comparison

**Fact Pattern:**

MiningCorp is evaluating a copper mining opportunity in two jurisdictions with identical geology and production profiles but different fiscal regimes:

**Project Economics (both jurisdictions, Years 1-10):**
- Capital expenditure (Year 0-1): $500,000,000
- Annual production (Years 2-10): 100,000 tonnes copper
- Copper price: $8,000 per tonne
- Annual operating costs: $300,000,000
- Decommissioning costs (Year 10): $50,000,000

**Jurisdiction A: Concession Regime**
- Royalty: 5% of gross revenue
- Corporate income tax: 30%
- Capital allowances: Straight-line depreciation over 10 years
- Ring-fencing: Project-level
- Loss carry-forward: Indefinite, no uplift

**Jurisdiction B: PSC-Style Licence**
- Royalty: 8% of gross production (in kind)
- Cost recovery ceiling: 70% of available production
- Profit share: Government 60%, Contractor 40% (fixed)
- Capital recovery: 20% per annum (5 years)
- Income tax: In-lieu (covered by profit share)

**Required:** Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of contractor cash flows over the project life (discount rate: 10%), and determine which regime is more favorable.

**Solution:**

**Assumptions for Simplified Calculation:**
- Focus on Year 2 (first full production year) as representative
- Ignore time value complications in full 10-year NPV (illustrative only)

---

**JURISDICTION A: CONCESSION REGIME (Year 2 Analysis)**

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Revenue and Royalty**
```
Production:                               100,000 tonnes
Price:                                    $8,000/tonne
Gross Revenue:                            $800,000,000

Royalty (5%):                             $40,000,000
```

**Step 2: Calculate Taxable Profit**
```
Gross Revenue:                            $800,000,000
Less: Royalty:                            ($40,000,000)
Less: Operating costs:                    ($300,000,000)
                                          _______________
                                          $460,000,000
Less: Capital allowances (depreciation):  ($50,000,000) [10% of $500m]
                                          _______________
Taxable Profit (Year 2):                  $410,000,000
```

**Note:** Year 1 capital expenditure of $500m is being depreciated. In Year 1, there was no revenue, so a loss of $50m (depreciation) was created, which can be carried forward to Year 2. For simplicity, we'll ignore this and assume steady-state Year 2+.

**Step 3: Calculate Income Tax**
```
Income Tax (30%):                         $410,000,000 × 30% = $123,000,000
```

**Step 4: Calculate Net Cash Flow (Year 2)**
```
Gross Revenue:                            $800,000,000
Less: Operating costs:                    ($300,000,000)
Less: Royalty:                            ($40,000,000)
Less: Income tax:                         ($123,000,000)
                                          _______________
NET CASH FLOW (Year 2):                   $337,000,000

Add back: Depreciation (non-cash):        $50,000,000
                                          _______________
CASH FLOW (after tax, before capex):      $387,000,000
```

(Note: In Year 0-1, capex of $500m was spent, reducing cash flows.)

**JURISDICTION B: PSC REGIME (Year 2 Analysis)**

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Production and Royalty**
```
Production:                               100,000 tonnes
Price:                                    $8,000/tonne
Gross Revenue:                            $800,000,000

Royalty (8% in kind):                     8,000 tonnes
Royalty ($ value):                        $64,000,000

Available Production:                     92,000 tonnes = $736,000,000
```

**Step 2: Calculate Cost Recovery**

**Year 2 Cost Recovery Claim:**
```
Operating costs:                          $300,000,000
Capital amortization (20% of $500m):      $100,000,000
                                          _______________
Total cost recovery claim:                $400,000,000
```

**Apply Cost Recovery Ceiling:**
```
Cost recovery ceiling (70%):              70% × $736,000,000 = $515,200,000

Claim:                                    $400,000,000
Actual recovery:                          $400,000,000 (within ceiling)
```

**Step 3: Calculate Profit Production**
```
Available Production:                     $736,000,000
Less: Cost recovery:                      ($400,000,000)
                                          _______________
Profit Production:                        $336,000,000
```

**Step 4: Split Profit Production**
```
Government share (60%):                   $201,600,000
Contractor share (40%):                   $134,400,000
```

**Step 5: Calculate Total Contractor Entitlement**
```
Cost recovery:                            $400,000,000
Profit share:                             $134,400,000
                                          _______________
TOTAL CONTRACTOR ENTITLEMENT:             $534,400,000

Less: No income tax (in-lieu):            $0
                                          _______________
NET CASH FLOW (Year 2):                   $534,400,000
```

(Note: This is contractor's revenue equivalent; actual cash flow is this minus operating costs paid: $534,400,000 - $300,000,000 = $234,400,000 net cash after opex.)

**COMPARISON (Year 2):**

| **Metric** | **Jurisdiction A (Concession)** | **Jurisdiction B (PSC)** |
|------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Gross Revenue | $800,000,000 | $800,000,000 |
| Government Royalty | $40,000,000 (5%) | $64,000,000 (8%) |
| Contractor Net (pre-opex) | $760,000,000 | $534,400,000 |
| Operating Costs | $300,000,000 | $300,000,000 |
| Taxable/Profit Base | $410,000,000 | $336,000,000 (profit prod) |
| Income Tax | $123,000,000 | $0 (in-lieu) |
| **Contractor Net Cash** | **$337,000,000** | **$234,400,000** |
| **Government Take** | **$163,000,000 (20.4%)** | **$265,600,000 (33.2%)** |

**Analysis:**

**Jurisdiction A (Concession)** is more favorable to the contractor:
- Lower effective government take (20.4% vs. 33.2%)
- Higher annual cash flow ($337m vs. $234m)
- Lower royalty burden (5% vs. 8%)

**Jurisdiction B (PSC)** provides:
- Greater government revenue upfront
- Simpler tax administration (no income tax)
- More transparent profit sharing

**NPV Consideration (Simplified):**

If we assume steady-state Year 2 cash flows for Years 2-10 (9 years) and discount at 10%:

**NPV Factor (9-year annuity at 10%):** 5.759

**Jurisdiction A NPV:**
```
Annual cash flow:                         $337,000,000
NPV of operating years:                   $337,000,000 × 5.759 = $1,940,783,000
Less: Initial capex (Year 0-1):           ($500,000,000)
                                          _______________
NPV (approximate):                        $1,440,783,000
```

**Jurisdiction B NPV:**
```
Annual cash flow:                         $234,400,000
NPV of operating years:                   $234,400,000 × 5.759 = $1,349,946,000
Less: Initial capex:                      ($500,000,000)
                                          _______________
NPV (approximate):                        $849,946,000
```

**Conclusion:**

**Jurisdiction A (Concession)** delivers approximately **70% higher NPV** ($1.44bn vs. $0.85bn) to the contractor, making it the more attractive investment, despite both projects having identical geology and production profiles. The PSC regime's higher government take and royalty significantly reduce contractor returns.

**Key Takeaway:** Fiscal regime structure is often as important as geological prospectivity in investment decisions for extractive industries.

## 6. Key Examination Points and Summary

### 6.1 Critical Concepts for ADIT Candidates

1. **Distinguish ownership models**: Concession (ownership transfer) vs. PSC (state ownership retained)

2. **Understand fiscal progressivity**: How government take adjusts with profitability (R-Factor, sliding scales)

3. **Master cost recovery mechanics**: Ceiling limitations, uplift calculations, depreciation vs. immediate expensing

4. **Ring-fencing implications**: Field, license, or contract-level isolation of profits and losses

5. **Cross-border considerations**: Treaty application, transfer pricing in extractive context, permanent establishment rules

6. **Recent developments**: UK Energy Profits Levy, Pillar Two impacts, global shift to higher resource taxation

### 6.2 Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing cost recovery with tax deductions**: PSC cost recovery is contractual entitlement, not tax deduction
- **Ignoring cost recovery ceilings**: Annual limits can defer contractor recovery for years
- **Misapplying ring-fencing**: Assuming losses can offset non-extractive income
- **Overlooking uplift**: Time value compensation on unrecovered costs is material
- **Treaty misapplication**: Extractive activities often have special treaty rules

### 6.3 Practice Recommendations

- Work through multi-year PSC calculations with varying R-Factors
- Compare effective government take across different fiscal designs
- Analyze impact of fiscal changes on marginal field economics
- Practice transfer pricing analysis for related-party service costs
- Review recent case law on extractive industry disputes (ICSID, tax tribunals)

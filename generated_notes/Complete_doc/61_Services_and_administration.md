# 61. Services and Administration

## 1. Introduction

**Intra-group services** are pervasive in oil and gas multinationals: **management services**, **HR and payroll**, **IT and cybersecurity**, **legal and compliance**, **finance and accounting**, **tax advisory**, **treasury services**, and **insurance**. These services are often provided by **shared service centers** or **regional headquarters** to achieve **economies of scale**, **standardization**, and **centralized expertise**.

From a transfer pricing perspective, the key questions are: (1) Does the service provide **economic value** to the recipient (the **benefit test**)? (2) What is the **arm's length charge** (cost plus markup, fixed fee, or allocation key)? (3) Are the services **duplicative** or **shareholder activities** (non-deductible)?

This chapter examines the **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines Chapter VII** (Special Considerations for Intra-Group Services), **types of services** in oil and gas, **benefit test application**, **transfer pricing methods** (Cost Plus, TNMM, CUT), **low value-adding intra-group services (LVAIS)** safe harbor, and **documentation requirements**.

---

## 2. Types of Services in Oil and Gas

### 2.1 Technical Services

**Examples**:
- **Engineering**: Facility design, pipeline engineering, subsea engineering
- **Reservoir management**: Simulation, production optimization, decline curve analysis
- **Drilling engineering**: Well planning, casing design, mud program
- **HSE (Health, Safety, Environment)**: Safety audits, environmental compliance, risk assessments

**Provider**: Parent or regional technical center employing specialized engineers

**Transfer pricing method**: **Cost Plus** (8-15% markup on costs)

**Benefit test**: Services must provide **technical value** (e.g., optimizing production, reducing drilling costs, ensuring regulatory compliance).

### 2.2 Administrative and Support Services

**Examples**:
- **HR and payroll**: Recruitment, payroll processing, benefits administration
- **IT**: Network management, cybersecurity, software licensing, help desk
- **Finance and accounting**: Bookkeeping, financial reporting, audit coordination
- **Legal**: Contract review, regulatory filings, litigation management
- **Procurement**: Supplier management, contract negotiation (see Chapter 58)

**Provider**: Shared service center (SSC) or regional headquarters

**Transfer pricing method**: **Cost Plus** (5-10% markup) or **Cost allocation** (direct cost recharge with minimal markup)

**Benefit test**: Services must enhance **commercial position** of recipient; avoid duplicating services recipient already performs.

### 2.3 Management and Governance Services

**Examples**:
- **Strategic planning**: Business development, M&A advisory
- **Corporate governance**: Board support, shareholder reporting
- **Investor relations**: Analyst presentations, investor communications
- **Group policies**: Development of group-wide policies (HSE, ethics, anti-corruption)

**Transfer pricing issue**: Many governance services are **shareholder activities** (benefiting parent, not subsidiaries) and should **not be recharged**.

**OECD Guidance** [Chapter VII, para. 7.9]:

> "Costs of establishing and maintaining the capital structure of the group, including the costs of acquiring participations, and costs related to the legal requirements of management and reporting by the parent company are borne by the parent company and should not be recharged to subsidiaries."

**Examples of shareholder activities** (non-deductible):

| **Activity** | **Shareholder Activity?** | **Deductible?** |
|---|---|---|
| **M&A due diligence** (parent acquiring new subsidiary) | ✓ Yes (benefits parent as investor) | ✗ No |
| **Investor relations** (parent's presentations to shareholders) | ✓ Yes | ✗ No |
| **Parent's statutory audit** | ✓ Yes | ✗ No |
| **Group policy development** (HSE, compliance) applicable to all subsidiaries | ✗ No (benefits subsidiaries' operations) | ✓ Yes (deductible) |

---

## 3. Benefit Test

### 3.1 OECD Guidance

**OECD Chapter VII, para. 7.6**:

> "An intra-group service has been rendered when an activity provides a member of the MNE group with economic or commercial value to enhance its commercial position."

**Three key principles**:

1. **Economic value**: Service must provide tangible benefit (cost savings, revenue enhancement, risk reduction)
2. **Commercial enhancement**: Service must improve recipient's ability to compete or operate efficiently
3. **Arms-length test**: Would an independent enterprise in similar circumstances pay for the service?

### 3.2 Application Examples

**A. IT Helpdesk Services**

```
Shared Service Center (SSC, Singapore) provides IT helpdesk to 15 operating affiliates:

Service: 24/7 helpdesk (password resets, software troubleshooting, hardware support)

Benefit test analysis:
✓ Economic value: Reduces downtime (employees resolve IT issues faster)
✓ Commercial enhancement: Enables employees to focus on core operations (not IT troubleshooting)
✓ Arms-length test: Independent companies use IT helpdesk services (Dell, HP, managed service providers)

Conclusion: ✓ Benefit test passed; service fee deductible
```

**B. Parent's Investor Relations**

```
Parent (UK) prepares quarterly earnings presentations for shareholders:

Service: Financial analysts presentations, investor roadshows, annual reports

Benefit test analysis:
✗ Economic value to subsidiaries: No direct benefit (presentations are about parent's consolidated results)
✗ Commercial enhancement: Subsidiaries' operations not improved
✗ Arms-length test: Independent subsidiaries do not pay parent for investor relations

Conclusion: ✗ Shareholder activity; not deductible by subsidiaries
```

**C. Group HSE Policy Development**

```
Parent (Norway) develops group-wide HSE policies (safety standards, environmental compliance):

Service: Policy manuals, training materials, compliance monitoring

Benefit test analysis:
✓ Economic value: Reduces risk of accidents, regulatory fines
✓ Commercial enhancement: Standardized HSE practices improve safety record (competitive advantage in bidding)
✓ Arms-length test: Independent companies purchase HSE consulting services (DNV, Lloyd's Register)

Conclusion: ✓ Benefit test passed; service fee deductible
```

### 3.3 Duplication Test

**Issue**: If subsidiary already performs a service **in-house**, charging for duplicative service from parent may fail benefit test.

**Example**:

```
OpCo (Angola) employs 5 in-house accountants performing financial reporting.

SSC (Netherlands) also prepares financial reports for OpCo; charges $500,000 annually.

Benefit test analysis:
- OpCo already has capability (5 accountants)
- SSC service is **duplicative** (same function performed twice)
- Unless SSC provides **additional value** (e.g., IFRS expertise not available in Angola, consolidation of group reports), charge may fail benefit test

Conclusion: ✗ Likely fails benefit test; $500,000 deduction may be disallowed
```

**Defense**: Document **value-added** by SSC (e.g., IFRS technical expertise, group consolidation, faster close process).

---

## 4. Transfer Pricing Methods

### 4.1 Cost Plus Method

**Application**: Most common method for **support services** where the service provider is a **cost center** with limited risk.

**Formula**:
```
Service Fee = (Direct Costs + Indirect Costs) × (1 + Markup)
```

**Typical markups**:

| **Service Type** | **Typical Markup** | **Rationale** |
|---|---|---|
| **Routine services** (payroll, bookkeeping) | 3-8% | Low complexity, low risk |
| **Professional services** (legal, tax, HR consulting) | 8-15% | Specialized expertise, moderate risk |
| **Technical services** (engineering, reservoir management) | 10-20% | High expertise, proprietary knowledge |

**Example**:

```
SSC (Singapore) provides HR and payroll services to 10 operating affiliates:

Annual costs (2025):
- Salaries (20 HR professionals): $2.5 million
- HR software licenses: $300,000
- Office and overhead (allocated): $700,000
Total costs: $3.5 million

Comparable markup analysis:
- Independent HR outsourcing providers (ADP, Aon Hewitt): EBIT/Costs of 6-10%
- Selected markup: 8%

Service fee: $3.5M × 1.08 = $3.78 million

Allocation to affiliates (based on headcount):
- Angola OpCo (25% of total headcount): $945,000
- Brazil OpCo (20%): $756,000
- [Others]: $2.079 million
```

### 4.2 Cost Allocation (No Markup)

**Application**: For **purely administrative** services with **no value-added** (e.g., invoice processing, data entry), cost allocation **without markup** may be appropriate.

**OECD Guidance** [Chapter VII, para. 7.33]:

> "Where the service provided is a purely administrative activity that does not involve any value creation, it may be appropriate to charge the costs without any markup."

**Example**:

```
Parent (UK) pays insurance premiums for group-wide property insurance; recharges to affiliates:

Insurance premium: $5 million (covers all group properties)
Parent's administrative cost: $50,000 (processing invoices, coordinating with insurer)

Transfer pricing:
- Each affiliate pays: Pro-rata share of $5M premium (based on insured property value)
- Parent's administrative cost ($50K): Absorbed by parent (no recharge)
- No markup applied (parent performs no value-added service; merely acts as intermediary)
```

### 4.3 Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)

**Application**: When service provider operates as **profit center** (not pure cost center) or when **Cost Plus comparables** are unavailable.

**Net Profit Indicator (NPI)**: **Operating Margin (EBIT/Sales)** or **Return on Costs (EBIT/Costs)**

**Example**:

```
Regional HQ (Netherlands) provides management, legal, tax, and treasury services to European operating companies:

Annual revenue (service fees charged): $20 million
Annual costs: $16 million
Operating profit (EBIT): $4 million
Operating margin: $4M ÷ $20M = 20%

Comparable companies analysis:
- Independent professional services firms (management consulting, legal, tax advisory): Operating margins 12-18%
- Selected arm's length range: 12-18%

Analysis: Regional HQ's 20% operating margin is **above** arm's length range (12-18%).

Implication: Service fees may be excessive; adjustment of $2M (to bring margin to 18%) may be required.
```

### 4.4 Low Value-Adding Intra-Group Services (LVAIS) Safe Harbor

**OECD BEPS Action 10**: Introduced simplified approach for **low value-adding services** (LVAIS) to reduce compliance burden.

**LVAIS definition** [Chapter VII, Section D]:
- **Supportive** in nature (not core business activities)
- **Not involving intangibles** or unique value creation
- **Not creating significant risk** for service provider

**Examples of LVAIS**:
- Accounting and bookkeeping
- HR administration (payroll, benefits)
- IT support (helpdesk, network management)
- General legal services (contract review, compliance)

**Safe harbor terms**:
- **Markup**: **5% on costs**
- **Cost base**: Direct and indirect costs (exclude shareholder costs)
- **Benefit test**: Still required (service must provide value)
- **Documentation**: Simplified (no benchmarking study required if 5% markup accepted)

**Adoption**:
- **Optional**: Jurisdictions may adopt LVAIS safe harbor
- **Countries adopting**: India, UK, Netherlands, Australia, South Africa (as of 2025)
- **Countries not adopting**: U.S. (IRS has not adopted; Cost Plus benchmarking still required)

**Example**:

```
SSC (Netherlands) provides accounting services to group affiliates:

Annual costs: $5 million
LVAIS safe harbor markup: 5%
Service fee: $5M × 1.05 = $5.25 million

Benefit: No benchmarking study required; 5% markup automatically accepted by Netherlands and recipient country tax authorities (if both adopted LVAIS).
```

---

## 5. Documentation Requirements

### 5.1 Service Agreement

**Key terms**:
- **Scope of services**: Detailed description (HR, IT, legal, finance, tax, etc.)
- **Service level**: Performance standards (e.g., IT helpdesk response time <2 hours)
- **Pricing**: Cost plus markup, fixed fee, or per-transaction fee
- **Payment terms**: Monthly, quarterly, or annual invoicing
- **Duration**: Multi-year agreement or annual renewal

**Example clause**:

> "Service Provider (SSC Netherlands) shall provide the following services to Recipient (Angola OpCo):
> - HR and payroll services (recruitment, payroll processing, benefits administration)
> - IT support (helpdesk, network management, software licensing)
> - Finance and accounting (general ledger, financial reporting, audit coordination)
>
> Service fees shall be calculated on a Cost Plus basis: total costs (direct and allocated indirect) plus 8% markup, invoiced quarterly. Payment due within 30 days of invoice."

### 5.2 Cost Allocation Methodology

**Critical**: Document **how costs are allocated** to each recipient.

**Allocation keys**:

| **Service** | **Allocation Key** |
|---|---|
| **HR and payroll** | Number of employees |
| **IT support** | Number of users, devices, or help desk tickets |
| **Finance and accounting** | Number of transactions, or revenue |
| **Legal** | Time spent (based on time tracking) or number of contracts reviewed |
| **Management** | Revenue, assets, or headcount |

**Example**:

```
SSC total costs: $10 million

Allocation to affiliates:

Angola OpCo:
- Headcount: 200 (20% of total group)
- HR allocation: $10M HR costs × 20% = $2M
- Markup (8%): $160,000
- HR service fee: $2.16M

Brazil OpCo:
- Headcount: 150 (15% of total)
- HR allocation: $10M × 15% = $1.5M
- Markup: $120,000
- HR service fee: $1.62M
```

### 5.3 Benchmarking Study (if not using LVAIS safe harbor)

**Required components**:

1. **Comparables search**: Independent service providers (ADP, Aon, Accenture for HR/IT; Big 4 for tax/legal; McKinsey, Bain for management consulting)
2. **Financial data**: EBIT/Costs or EBIT/Sales margins
3. **Functional comparability**: Similar services, similar risk profile
4. **Arm's length range**: Interquartile range (25th-75th percentile)

**Sample comparables** (HR and IT services):

| **Company** | **Services** | **EBIT/Costs** |
|---|---|---|
| **ADP** | Payroll and HR outsourcing | 25% |
| **Accenture** | IT consulting and managed services | 15% |
| **Cognizant** | IT services and BPO | 18% |
| **Genpact** | Finance and accounting BPO | 12% |
| **Median** | — | **16.5%** |

**Conclusion**: 8% markup is **within arm's length range** (12-25%), though at lower end (justified by routine nature of services).

### 5.4 Benefit Test Documentation

**For each service, document**:

1. **Description**: What service was provided (e.g., "IT helpdesk support for 500 users")
2. **Benefit**: How service enhanced recipient's commercial position (e.g., "Reduced IT downtime by 30%, enabling employees to maintain productivity")
3. **Alternative cost**: What recipient would have paid for external service (e.g., "Independent IT helpdesk providers quote $1.5M annually vs. $1.2M charged by SSC")
4. **Arms-length test**: Would independent company purchase service? (e.g., "Yes; companies of similar size outsource IT helpdesk to Dell, HP, or managed service providers")

---

## 6. Tax Authority Challenges

### 6.1 Shareholder Activities (Non-Deductible)

**Common challenge**: Tax authorities disallow service charges claiming they are **shareholder activities** benefiting parent, not subsidiary.

**Example**:

```
Parent (UK) charges subsidiaries for:
- M&A due diligence ($5M): Costs of acquiring new subsidiary in Nigeria
- Investor relations ($2M): Quarterly earnings presentations to shareholders
- Parent's audit ($1M): Statutory audit of parent company financial statements

Tax authority (Nigeria) challenge:
- All three services are **shareholder activities** (benefit parent as owner, not Nigerian subsidiary's operations)
- Disallows $8M deduction (Nigerian subsidiary's portion)
- Additional tax: $8M × 30% = $2.4M + penalties
```

**Defense**: Demonstrate services **directly benefit subsidiary**:
- M&A due diligence: If costs relate to **post-acquisition integration** (not acquisition itself), may be deductible
- Investor relations: If includes **subsidiary-specific presentations** to lenders, joint venture partners, may be partially deductible
- Parent's audit: Not deductible (clear shareholder activity)

**Best practice**: **Segregate** shareholder activities (absorbed by parent) from operational services (rechargeable to subsidiaries).

### 6.2 Duplication (Benefit Test Failure)

**Challenge**: Subsidiary already performs service in-house; external service charge is duplicative.

**Example**:

```
OpCo (Brazil) employs 10 in-house IT staff (cost: $1M annually).
SSC (Netherlands) also provides IT services to OpCo; charges $1.5M annually.

Tax authority challenge:
- OpCo already has IT capability ($1M in-house cost)
- SSC service is **duplicative**
- Disallows $1.5M deduction

Defense:
- Document **value-added** by SSC (e.g., cybersecurity expertise not available in-house, 24/7 support vs. business hours only, enterprise software licenses negotiated by SSC at lower cost)
- Demonstrate **cost savings**: Combined cost ($1M in-house + $1.5M SSC = $2.5M) is lower than fully outsourcing to independent provider (e.g., $3M quote from Accenture)
```

**Best practice**: **Eliminate duplication** (consolidate IT function in SSC, eliminate in-house staff) or **clearly document incremental value** of SSC services.

### 6.3 Excessive Markup

**Challenge**: Markup is higher than arm's length range.

**Example**:

```
SSC (Singapore) provides payroll services with 15% markup.

Comparables analysis:
- Independent payroll providers (ADP, Aon): EBIT/Costs of 6-10%
- SSC markup (15%) is **above** arm's length range

Tax authority adjustment: Reduce markup from 15% to 10% (upper end of range).

Impact:
- Original service fee: $5M × 1.15 = $5.75M
- Arm's length service fee: $5M × 1.10 = $5.50M
- Disallowed deduction: $250,000
- Additional tax (30% rate): $75,000 + penalties
```

**Defense**: Document **value-added** justifying higher markup:
- Complexity (multi-country payroll vs. single-country)
- Specialized expertise (expatriate tax compliance, equity compensation)
- Risk (SSC guarantees accuracy; independent providers disclaim liability)

## 7. Worked Example

═══════════════════════════════════════════
**WORKED EXAMPLE: Transfer Pricing for Shared Service Center (SSC)**
═══════════════════════════════════════════

**Facts:**

EnergyGlobal Group establishes **Shared Service Center (SSC)** in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia** to provide administrative services to **12 operating affiliates** across Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa.

**Services provided by SSC (2025)**:
1. **Finance and accounting**: General ledger, accounts payable/receivable, financial reporting
2. **HR and payroll**: Recruitment, payroll processing, benefits administration
3. **IT support**: Helpdesk, network management, software licensing
4. **Procurement**: Supplier management, contract negotiation (see Chapter 58)

**SSC financial data (2025)**:

```
Costs:
- Salaries (100 professionals: 40 finance, 30 HR, 20 IT, 10 procurement): $5.0 million
- Software licenses (ERP, HR systems, IT tools): $1.0 million
- Office rent and facilities (Kuala Lumpur): $800,000
- Travel and training: $500,000
- Allocated overhead (utilities, depreciation): $700,000
Total costs: $8.0 million

Operating affiliates served:
- 12 affiliates (Nigeria, Angola, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Australia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Malaysia, India, China)
- Total group headcount: 5,000 employees
```

**Transfer pricing policy**: **Cost Plus 10%**

```
Service fees charged: $8.0M × 1.10 = $8.8 million
Allocation to affiliates: Based on headcount (see below)
```

**Tax authority audit** (Nigeria, one of the operating affiliates):
- Challenges 10% markup as excessive; claims 5% is appropriate (LVAIS safe harbor)
- Also questions whether Nigerian OpCo receives value (benefit test)

**Requirements**:

1. Calculate service fee allocation to each affiliate
2. Benchmark 10% markup
3. Conduct benefit test analysis for Nigerian OpCo
4. Assess LVAIS safe harbor applicability
5. Calculate impact of Nigerian adjustment

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Service Fee Allocation**

**Allocation key**: Headcount (number of employees in each affiliate)

| **Affiliate** | **Headcount** | **% of Total** | **Service Fee** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Nigeria OpCo** | 800 | 16% | $1.408 million |
| **Angola OpCo** | 600 | 12% | $1.056 million |
| **Kazakhstan OpCo** | 500 | 10% | $880,000 |
| **Indonesia OpCo** | 700 | 14% | $1.232 million |
| **Australia OpCo** | 400 | 8% | $704,000 |
| **Qatar OpCo** | 300 | 6% | $528,000 |
| **Saudi Arabia OpCo** | 350 | 7% | $616,000 |
| **UAE OpCo** | 250 | 5% | $440,000 |
| **Iraq OpCo** | 450 | 9% | $792,000 |
| **Malaysia OpCo** | 200 | 4% | $352,000 |
| **India OpCo** | 300 | 6% | $528,000 |
| **China OpCo** | 150 | 3% | $264,000 |
| **Total** | **5,000** | **100%** | **$8.8 million** |

**Step 2: Benchmarking Analysis**

**Comparable companies** (finance, HR, IT shared service centers and BPO providers):

| **Company** | **Services** | **EBIT/Sales** | **EBIT/Costs** (approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Genpact** | Finance and accounting BPO | 10.5% | 11.7% |
| **WNS** | HR, IT, finance BPO | 12.0% | 13.6% |
| **Concentrix** | IT and customer service BPO | 9.0% | 9.9% |
| **Cognizant** | IT services and BPO | 15.0% | 17.6% |
| **Accenture** | IT and business process outsourcing | 13.5% | 15.6% |
| **Median** | — | **12.0%** | **13.6%** |
| **Interquartile range** | — | **9.0-15.0%** | **9.9-17.6%** |

**SSC markup**: **10% on costs**

**Conclusion**: 10% markup is **within arm's length range** (9.9-17.6% IQR), though **below median** (13.6%).

**Rationale for lower markup**:
- SSC performs **routine services** (payroll, accounting, IT helpdesk)
- **Limited risk**: SSC does not guarantee results (vs. independent BPO providers who may offer SLAs with penalties)
- **Captive center**: No sales/marketing costs (vs. independent providers who incur customer acquisition costs)

**Step 3: Benefit Test Analysis (Nigerian OpCo)**

**Question**: Does SSC provide economic value to Nigerian OpCo?

**Analysis**:

**Service 1: Finance and accounting**

Nigerian OpCo's alternative:
- **In-house**: Employ 15 accountants in Lagos @ $50K avg = $750K annually
- **External BPO**: Genpact Nigeria quote: $1.2M annually

SSC service fee (finance portion, 40% of total):
- Nigerian OpCo total fee: $1.408M
- Finance portion: $1.408M × 40% = $563K

**Comparison**:
- SSC: $563K
- In-house: $750K
- External: $1.2M

**Conclusion**: ✓ SSC provides **cost savings** ($187K vs. in-house, $637K vs. external)

**Service 2: HR and payroll**

Nigerian OpCo's alternative:
- **In-house**: Employ 5 HR professionals @ $40K = $200K, plus payroll software ($50K) = $250K total
- **External**: ADP Nigeria quote: $450K annually

SSC service fee (HR portion, 30% of total):
- Nigerian OpCo HR fee: $1.408M × 30% = $422K

**Comparison**:
- SSC: $422K
- In-house: $250K
- External: $450K

**Observation**: SSC ($422K) is **more expensive** than in-house ($250K) but **cheaper** than external ($450K).

**Additional value analysis**:
- SSC provides **specialized expertise** (expatriate tax compliance, equity compensation) not available in Nigerian in-house team
- SSC provides **multi-country payroll** (Nigerian OpCo has expatriates from 10 countries; in-house team lacks expertise)
- SSC provides **standardization** across group (consistent processes, data formats for group consolidation)

**Conclusion**: ✓ SSC provides **value** beyond cost (specialized expertise, multi-country capability, standardization)

**Service 3: IT support**

Nigerian OpCo's alternative:
- **In-house**: Employ 3 IT staff @ $35K = $105K
- **External**: Dell IT support quote: $350K annually

SSC service fee (IT portion, 20% of total):
- Nigerian OpCo IT fee: $1.408M × 20% = $282K

**Comparison**:
- SSC: $282K
- In-house: $105K
- External: $350K

**Observation**: SSC ($282K) is **more expensive** than in-house ($105K) but **cheaper** than external ($350K).

**Additional value**:
- SSC provides **24/7 support** (vs. business hours only for in-house)
- SSC provides **cybersecurity** monitoring (Nigerian OpCo faces high cybersecurity risk; in-house team lacks expertise)
- SSC provides **enterprise software licenses** (negotiated by SSC at group discount; Nigerian OpCo would pay higher rates individually)

**Conclusion**: ✓ SSC provides **incremental value** (24/7 support, cybersecurity, software discounts)

**Overall benefit test**: ✓ **PASSED** — SSC provides economic value to Nigerian OpCo (cost savings on finance services, specialized expertise on HR, cybersecurity and 24/7 support on IT).

**Step 4: LVAIS Safe Harbor Applicability**

**OECD LVAIS criteria**:

| **Criterion** | **SSC Services** | **Meets LVAIS?** |
|---|---|---|
| **Supportive in nature** (not core business) | ✓ Finance, HR, IT are support functions (not oil & gas production) | ✓ Yes |
| **Not involving intangibles** | ✓ Routine accounting, payroll, IT helpdesk (no proprietary IP) | ✓ Yes |
| **Not creating significant risk** | ✓ SSC does not guarantee results, assumes limited risk | ✓ Yes |

**Conclusion**: SSC services **qualify for LVAIS safe harbor**.

**LVAIS safe harbor terms**:
- **Markup**: **5% on costs** (automatic acceptance if both jurisdictions adopted LVAIS)
- **SSC current markup**: **10%**

**Implication**:
- If Nigeria and Malaysia both adopted LVAIS, Nigerian OpCo **could elect** to use 5% markup (reduces service fee)
- However, **benchmarking shows 10% is arm's length** (within 9.9-17.6% range); Nigerian OpCo is **not required** to reduce to 5%

**Strategic decision**:
- **Option 1**: Maintain 10% markup; defend with benchmarking study
- **Option 2**: Elect LVAIS 5% safe harbor (reduces service fee, simplifies documentation)

**Recommendation**: **Maintain 10% markup** (arm's length; no adjustment required).

**Step 5: Nigerian Tax Authority Adjustment Impact**

**Nigeria proposal**: Reduce markup from 10% to 5% (LVAIS safe harbor).

```
Current service fee (10% markup): $1.408 million
Nigeria-proposed fee (5% markup):
- Nigerian OpCo cost allocation: $1.408M ÷ 1.10 = $1.280M (cost base)
- 5% markup: $1.280M × 1.05 = $1.344M
Reduction: $1.408M - $1.344M = $64,000

Nigeria CIT rate: 30%
Additional tax (if deduction disallowed): $64,000 × 30% = $19,200
Plus penalties (50%): $9,600
Total Nigeria liability: $28,800
```

**SSC defense**:

1. **Benchmarking study**: Present comparables showing 10% markup within arm's length range (9.9-17.6%)
2. **Benefit test**: Document cost savings and incremental value provided by SSC (see Step 3 analysis)
3. **LVAIS is optional**: OECD LVAIS safe harbor is **optional**; taxpayers not required to use 5% if higher markup is arm's length
4. **Nigeria has not adopted LVAIS**: If Nigeria has not formally adopted LVAIS safe harbor, 5% is not binding

**Likely outcome**: Nigerian tax authority **accepts 10% markup** after reviewing benchmarking study and benefit analysis.

**Proactive measure**: Consider reducing markup to **8-9%** (lower end of comparable range) to reduce audit risk, or pursue **bilateral APA** (Malaysia-Nigeria) for 5-year certainty.

## 8. Key Takeaways

1. **Intra-group services** include technical, administrative, management, and governance services; common in oil & gas shared service centers and regional headquarters.

2. **Benefit test is critical**: Services must provide **economic or commercial value** to recipient; **shareholder activities** (M&A due diligence, investor relations, parent's audit) are **non-deductible**.

3. **Transfer pricing methods**:
   - **Cost Plus** (most common): 5-15% markup depending on service complexity
   - **Cost allocation** (no markup): For purely administrative activities with no value-added
   - **TNMM**: When service provider operates as profit center (operating margin 10-18%)

4. **LVAIS safe harbor** (OECD BEPS Action 10): **5% markup on costs** for low value-adding services (finance, HR, IT, legal); **optional** (jurisdictions may adopt); **simplifies documentation** (no benchmarking required).

5. **Duplication test**: If subsidiary already performs service in-house, external service charge may be **duplicative** and fail benefit test; defense requires demonstrating **incremental value** (specialized expertise, cost savings, 24/7 support).

6. **Documentation requirements**: Service agreements, cost allocation methodologies, benchmarking study (unless LVAIS safe harbor), benefit test analysis (demonstrating economic value).

7. **Tax authority challenges**: Common issues include:
   - **Shareholder activities**: Services benefiting parent, not subsidiaries (non-deductible)
   - **Duplication**: Services already performed in-house (fails benefit test)
   - **Excessive markup**: Markup above arm's length range (adjustment to reduce)

8. **Allocation keys**: Choose appropriate key for each service type:
   - HR/payroll: Headcount
   - IT: Number of users, devices, or tickets
   - Finance: Revenue, transactions, or assets
   - Legal: Time spent or contracts reviewed

9. **Benchmarking**: Use independent service providers as comparables:
   - Finance/accounting: Genpact, WNS, Concentrix (9-17% EBIT/Costs)
   - HR: ADP, Aon Hewitt (6-10%)
   - IT: Accenture, Cognizant (15-18%)

10. **Best practices**:
    - **Segregate** shareholder activities (absorbed by parent) from operational services (rechargeable)
    - **Eliminate duplication** (consolidate functions in SSC or clearly document incremental value)
    - **Time tracking** (for services allocated by time spent, e.g., legal)
    - **Consider LVAIS safe harbor** (5% markup) for routine services if both jurisdictions adopted
    - **Bilateral APAs** for material service arrangements (>$5M annual fees)

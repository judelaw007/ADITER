## 1. Core Framework of Iraq Petroleum Fiscal Regime

### 1.1 Introduction and Statutory Basis

Iraq's petroleum fiscal regime represents one of the most distinctive service contract models globally, characterized by **state retention of full ownership** over hydrocarbon resources while international oil companies (IOCs) act as **service providers** rather than production sharers or concessionaires. This structure emerged from Iraq's constitutional framework (Article 111 of the 2005 Constitution) which vests ownership of oil and gas in "all the people of Iraq."

The legal foundation comprises:
- **Iraqi Petroleum Law** (various drafts, not yet finalized federally)
- **Federal Budget Law** (annual authorizations for oil contracts)
- **Model Contract Templates** (2009 onwards for TSC/DPSC rounds)
- **Income Tax Law No. 113 of 1982** (as amended, establishing 15% federal corporate tax rate)
- **Investment Law No. 13 of 2006** (tax incentives framework)

### 1.2 TSC vs. DPSC Structure

**Technical Service Contracts (TSCs)**: Applied to fields requiring **exploration and appraisal** followed by development. The contractor bears exploration risk and receives remuneration only upon commercial production. TSCs were utilized in Iraq's Fourth Bid Round (2012) for exploration blocks.

**Development and Production Service Contracts (DPSCs)**: Applied to **proven developed fields** with existing infrastructure and known reserves. The contractor focuses on production optimization, enhanced recovery, and plateau maintenance. DPSCs were the primary vehicle in Iraq's 2009-2010 bid rounds covering super-giant fields.

**Key Distinction**: DPSCs involve **no exploration risk** as they apply to fields with certified reserves, whereas TSCs require contractors to fund exploration with recovery contingent on discovery.

| **Feature** | **TSC** | **DPSC** |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Application** | Exploration blocks | Proven/developed fields |
| **Contractor Risk** | High (exploration risk) | Moderate (production risk) |
| **Reserve Certainty** | Uncertain | Proven/probable reserves |
| **Contract Duration** | 20-25 years | 20 years typical |
| **Example Fields** | Fourth Round blocks (Akkas gas) | Rumaila, West Qurna, Zubair |

### 1.3 Service Fee Model (Not PSC)

Critically, Iraqi contracts are **not Production Sharing Contracts**. Contractors do not receive a share of production or "profit oil/gas." Instead, remuneration is structured as:
- **Per-barrel fee** ($/bbl) paid in cash (or occasionally oil equivalent)
- **Cost recovery** for approved capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX)
- **No equity in reserves** or production entitlement beyond contractual fees

This structure preserves state ownership throughout the value chain, distinguishing Iraq from PSC regimes in Kurdistan, Africa, or Southeast Asia.

## 2. Technical Rules: Remuneration and Tax Treatment

### 2.1 Remuneration Fee Structure

Iraq's remuneration fees are structured as **$/barrel fees** tied to incremental production above baseline levels. The fee structure is typically **tiered**, with rates adjusting based on production plateau achievement:

**Standard Structure:**
- **Plateau Production Target**: Contractually specified (e.g., 2.85 million bpd for West Qurna-2)
- **Remuneration Fee**: Fixed $/bbl rate bid competitively (e.g., $1.15/bbl for Rumaila)
- **Tiered Adjustments**: Fees may reduce if production exceeds certain thresholds or increase for enhanced recovery

**Major Field Examples (2009-2012 Bid Rounds):**

| **Field** | **Operator** | **Remuneration Fee ($/bbl)** | **Plateau Target (bpd)** | **Contract Type** |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Rumaila | BP/PetroChina | $1.15 (renegotiated from $2.00) | 2,850,000 | DPSC |
| West Qurna-1 | ExxonMobil/Shell | $1.90 (renegotiated from $1.90) | 2,325,000 | DPSC |
| West Qurna-2 | Lukoil/Statoil | $1.15 | 1,800,000 | DPSC |
| Zubair | ENI/Occidental/KOGAS | $2.00 (renegotiated to $2.30) | 1,200,000 | DPSC |
| Majnoon | Shell/Petronas | $1.39 | 1,800,000 | DPSC |

**Fee Compression Issues (2023-2025)**: Due to fiscal pressures and market conditions, Iraq has pursued **fee renegotiations** with multiple operators. Rumaila's fee was reduced from $2.00 to $1.15/bbl in 2020 renegotiations. Several operators have sought fee increases to account for inflation and cost overruns, leading to ongoing commercial disputes.

### 2.2 Cost Recovery Mechanism

Contractors recover **approved costs** from a designated portion of production revenues:
- **Cost Recovery Limit**: Typically capped at 40-50% of annual field production value
- **Recoverable Costs**: Approved CAPEX, OPEX, and financing costs (subject to government approval)
- **Carry-forward**: Unrecovered costs carried forward with interest (typically LIBOR-based rates)
- **Audit Requirements**: Annual cost audits by Iraqi authorities

**Non-Recoverable Costs**: Income taxes, penalties, costs exceeding approved budgets, and certain G&A allocations are not recoverable.

### 2.3 Tax Treatment

**Corporate Income Tax**: **15% federal rate** under Iraqi Income Tax Law No. 113 of 1982 (as amended). The tax base is **gross remuneration fee minus allowable deductions** (primarily costs, depreciation, and financing charges).

**Withholding Taxes**: **15% WHT** applies to:
- Service payments to non-resident subcontractors
- Interest payments to foreign lenders
- Royalty and technical service payments

**Tax Exemptions**: Some DPSCs include **tax stabilization clauses** or reduced rates negotiated in contract terms, though 15% federal rate remains standard.

**Depreciation**: Accelerated depreciation often permitted for petroleum assets (e.g., 33% declining balance for upstream equipment).

## 3. Kurdistan Region Differences

The **Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)** operates a separate petroleum framework under **Production Sharing Contracts**, not TSCs/DPSCs:
- **KRG Oil & Gas Law 2007**: Establishes PSC-based regime
- **Corporate Tax Rate**: Variable (often negotiated at 20-30%)
- **Production Sharing**: Contractors receive profit oil shares (typically 15-25% contractor share)
- **Constitutional Disputes**: Federal government disputes KRG authority to sign independent contracts

**Transfer Pricing Considerations**: Transactions between KRG and federal Iraq, or between contractor affiliates, face scrutiny under Iraqi transfer pricing regulations introduced in 2019 (based on OECD guidelines).

## 4. Application Methodology: Iraqi DPSC Calculation Framework

**Step 1**: Determine **gross production** and **incremental production** above baseline.

**Step 2**: Calculate **cost recovery** amount (capped at 40-50% of production value).

**Step 3**: Calculate **remuneration fee**: Incremental production (bbls) × $/bbl fee rate.

**Step 4**: Calculate **corporate income tax** (15%) on remuneration fee minus allowable deductions.

**Step 5**: Apply **withholding taxes** (15%) on applicable payments to non-residents.

**Step 6**: Determine **net contractor take** after all taxes and cost recovery.

## 5. Worked Example: Iraqi DPSC Calculation

**Scenario**: West Qurna Field DPSC

**Assumptions**:
- Remuneration fee: **$1.50/bbl**
- Annual production: **200 million barrels**
- Baseline production: **50 million barrels**
- Incremental production: **150 million barrels**
- Oil price: **$80/bbl**
- Annual CAPEX: **$1.2 billion**
- Annual OPEX: **$800 million**
- Cost recovery limit: **45% of production value**
- Corporate income tax rate: **15%**
- Depreciation: **$300 million** (allowed deduction)

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Production Value**
Gross production value = 200 million bbls × $80/bbl = **$16,000 million**

**Step 2: Calculate Cost Recovery**
Total recoverable costs = CAPEX + OPEX = $1,200m + $800m = **$2,000 million**
Cost recovery limit = 45% × $16,000m = **$7,200 million**
Actual cost recovery = min($2,000m, $7,200m) = **$2,000 million** (costs fully recovered)

**Step 3: Calculate Remuneration Fee**
Remuneration fee = Incremental production × $/bbl fee
= 150 million bbls × $1.50/bbl = **$225 million**

**Step 4: Calculate Corporate Income Tax**
Taxable income = Remuneration fee - Depreciation
= $225m - $300m = **-$75 million** (tax loss)
Tax payable = 15% × $0 (loss carried forward) = **$0**

**Alternative Scenario (No Depreciation Deduction)**:
Taxable income = $225 million
Corporate income tax = 15% × $225m = **$33.75 million**

**Step 5: Calculate Net Contractor Take**
Net contractor revenue = Cost recovery + Remuneration fee - Corporate income tax
= $2,000m + $225m - $33.75m = **$2,191.25 million** (assuming no depreciation benefit)

**Step 6: Calculate Government Take**
Government gross revenue = (Production value - Cost recovery - Remuneration fee) + Tax
= ($16,000m - $2,000m - $225m) + $33.75m = **$13,808.75 million**

**Government Take Percentage** = $13,808.75m / $16,000m = **86.3%**
**Contractor Take Percentage** = $2,191.25m / $16,000m = **13.7%**

**Key Observations**:
- The service fee model results in **very high government take** (typically 85-90%)
- Contractors face **limited upside** from oil price increases (fixed $/bbl fee)
- **Cost recovery certainty** is critical to contractor economics
- **Low remuneration fees** ($1.15-$2.30/bbl) necessitate large-scale operations for commercial viability

## 6. Recent Developments (2023-2025)

**Fee Renegotiations**: Multiple operators have renegotiated fees due to cost inflation and production challenges. Iraq's Ministry of Oil has resisted fee increases, leading to some operators exiting contracts (e.g., Shell from Majnoon).

**Federal-KRG Disputes**: Ongoing constitutional disputes over KRG's authority to export oil independently have impacted KRG PSCs, with federal government asserting exclusive export authority.

**New Licensing Rounds**: Iraq announced plans for Fifth and Sixth Bid Rounds (2024-2025) covering exploration blocks and gas fields, maintaining TSC/DPSC structure.

**ESG Requirements**: New contracts increasingly include environmental and social governance provisions, carbon reduction targets, and local content requirements.

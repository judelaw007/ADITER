Slide: Worked Example: Investment Structure Optimization

Here's the thing with fact pattern.  GreenEnergy Holdings Inc. (GEH), a Canadian public company, invests USD 500 million in a Mozambique LNG project. Expected annual dividends: USD 40 million (from Year 4). Projected exit gain: USD 200 million (Year 10). Mozambique: 32% corporate tax, 20% dividend WHT, 32% capital gains Canada: 26.5% corporate tax Canada-Mozambique treaty: 15% dividend WHT Netherlands-Mozambique treaty: 5% dividend WHT, capital gains exempt Question: Direct investment vs. Netherlands holding company? Now, analysis is interesting.  Option 1: Direct Investment Annual dividend tax (from Year 4): Mozambique WHT: USD 6.0M (15% × USD 40M) Canadian tax: USD 10.6M (26.5% × USD 40M) Foreign tax credit: USD 6.0M

Net Canadian tax: USD 4.6M Total annual tax: USD 10.6M Exit capital gain tax (Year 10): Mozambique CGT: USD 64.0M (32% × USD 200M) Canadian tax: USD 53.0M (26.5% × USD 200M) Foreign tax credit: USD 53.0M (limited to Canadian tax) Total CGT: USD 64.0M Total 10-year tax: USD 138.2M (7 years dividends + exit) Option 2: Netherlands Holding Company Annual dividend tax: Mozambique WHT: USD 2.0M (5% × USD 40M) Netherlands tax: USD 0 (participation exemption) Canadian tax: USD 10.6M (26.5% × USD 40M gross) Foreign tax credit: USD 2.0M Net Canadian tax: USD 8.6M Total annual tax: USD 10.6M Exit capital gain tax: Mozambique CGT: USD 0 (treaty exempt) Netherlands tax: USD 0 (participation exemption) Canadian tax: USD 53.0M (26.5% × USD 200M)

Total CGT: USD 53.0M Total 10-year tax: USD 127.2M Conclusion.  Tax savings: USD 11.0M (8% reduction), entirely from capital gains exemption under Netherlands-Mozambique treaty. Implementation requirements: Netherlands substance (office, staff, board meetings): ~EUR 100-150K annually Demonstrate business purpose beyond tax (e.g., regional hub for African investments) Address PPT risk through commercial substance Net savings after substance costs: ~USD 10M Recommendation: Netherlands structure viable if GEH establishes genuine regional presence and can demonstrate commercial substance satisfying beneficial ownership and PPT tests. Direct investment preferable if substance requirements cannot be met cost-effectively.

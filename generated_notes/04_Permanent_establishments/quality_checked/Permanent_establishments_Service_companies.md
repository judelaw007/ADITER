# Service Companies and Permanent Establishments in Energy Resources

## 1. Core Framework

**Service companies** in the energy sector provide specialized technical, operational, and support services to upstream and downstream oil and gas operators. The provision of these services across borders creates significant **permanent establishment (PE) risk**, potentially subjecting the service provider to taxation in the host country on profits attributable to the services performed.

### 1.1 Definition and Scope

**Service companies** are enterprises that provide specialized services to energy operators without taking ownership of production or hydrocarbon resources. Unlike contractors under **Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs)** or concession holders, service companies operate on a fee-for-service basis without participating in production entitlements.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Remuneration based on fees (daily rates, lump-sum, cost-plus) rather than production entitlement
- No direct interest in hydrocarbon reserves
- Limited duration of engagement (project-based or term contracts)
- Specialized technical expertise and equipment
- May involve cross-border personnel deployment

### 1.2 Types of Service Companies in Energy Sector

**Technical Services**:
- **Seismic survey companies**: Conduct geological and geophysical surveys (2D/3D seismic)
- **Drilling contractors**: Provide drilling rigs and crews (exploration, development, workover)
- **Well services**: Wireline, cementing, completion, stimulation services
- **Engineering consultants**: Reservoir engineering, production optimization, facilities design

**Construction and Installation**:
- **Offshore installation**: Platform installation, subsea infrastructure
- **Pipeline construction**: Onshore and offshore pipeline laying
- **Facilities construction**: Processing plants, storage facilities, refineries

**Operational Support**:
- **Maintenance and repair**: Equipment servicing, facility maintenance
- **Catering and accommodation**: Offshore platform catering, camp management
- **Transportation**: Helicopter services, marine support vessels
- **IT and communications**: Digital oilfield services, data management

### 1.3 PE Creation Risks for Service Providers

Service companies face **multiple PE exposure scenarios**:

**Fixed Place of Business PE (Article 5(1))**:
- Established office or facility in host country
- Project site serving as fixed place of business
- Equipment depot or storage facility
- Permanent onshore base for offshore operations

**Construction/Installation PE (Article 5(3))**:
- Construction, installation, or assembly projects exceeding time threshold
- Drilling operations (jurisdiction-specific treatment)
- Offshore platform installation
- Pipeline construction projects

**Service PE (UN Model Article 5(3)(b))**:
- Furnishing of services through employees/personnel
- Threshold: Activities continue for specified period (typically 183 days in any 12-month period)
- Applies where treaty includes UN Model service PE provision

**Dependent Agent PE (Article 5(5))**:
- Local agent with authority to conclude contracts
- Habitual exercise of contracting authority
- Service coordinator or procurement agent for service company

## 2. Technical Rules and Treaty Provisions

### 2.1 Service PE Thresholds - Treaty Variations

**PE Threshold Comparison Table**:

| **Treaty Model** | **Service PE Provision** | **Time Threshold** | **Activity Scope** |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **OECD Model** | No specific service PE provision | N/A | Services may create fixed place PE or dependent agent PE only |
| **UN Model Article 5(3)(b)** | Furnishing of services through employees or other personnel | 183 days within any 12-month period | Services for same or connected project |
| **US Model** | No specific service PE provision | N/A | Similar to OECD approach |
| **Common Bilateral Variations** | Service PE clause included | 90-183 days (varies) | Same or connected project; some aggregate all services |
| **Oil-rich Countries** | Service PE with low thresholds | 30-90 days common | Broad definition including supervisory services |

**Key Treaty Examples**:
- **India-Netherlands Treaty**: Services PE at 90 days
- **UK-Brazil Treaty**: No service PE provision (OECD approach)
- **Nigeria-China Treaty**: Services PE at 183 days for connected projects
- **Kazakhstan-UK Treaty**: Services PE at 6 months (183 days)
- **Indonesia-Australia Treaty**: Services PE at 120 days

**Time Calculation Methods**:
- **Calendar days**: Each day personnel present counts (even partial days)
- **12-month period**: Rolling 12-month period, not calendar year
- **Same or connected project**: Multiple contracts for same operator may be aggregated
- **Multiple service providers**: Generally counted separately unless related parties

### 2.2 Construction PE for Installation Services

**Article 5(3) OECD Model**: Building site, construction, assembly, or installation project constitutes PE if duration exceeds **12 months**.

**UN Model**: Reduces threshold to **6 months**, more favorable to source countries.

**Drilling Operations - Jurisdictional Variations**:
- **Offshore drilling rigs**: Treatment varies by treaty and domestic law
  - Some treaties explicitly include drilling operations in construction PE
  - Others treat drilling separately with specific thresholds
  - Time threshold: 6-12 months common
- **Onshore drilling**: More likely to constitute construction PE
- **Workover operations**: Generally shorter duration; may avoid PE threshold

**Installation Services**:
- Offshore platform installation, hook-up, and commissioning
- Subsea infrastructure installation (pipelines, flowlines, umbilicals)
- Time calculation: From commencement to completion (including mobilization/demobilization in some treaties)
- Multiple installations: May be treated as connected projects if for same concession

### 2.3 Dependent Agent PE (Article 5(5))

**Definition**: Person acting on behalf of enterprise who habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts binding the enterprise creates PE.

**Service Company Application**:
- **Local procurement agent**: Arranges service contracts with local operators
- **Service coordinator**: Manages service delivery, interfaces with client
- **Technical representative**: With authority to modify contract terms or scope

**Independent Agent Exception (Article 5(6))**:
- Broker, general commission agent, or independent agent acting in ordinary course of business
- Must be legally and economically independent
- Cannot devote activities wholly/almost wholly to principal

**Critical Factors**:
- Legal authority to bind service company
- Economic dependence on principal
- Risk assumption by agent
- Agent's own business premises and employees

### 2.4 Preparatory/Auxiliary Activities Exception (Article 5(4))

**Exclusions from PE**: Activities of preparatory or auxiliary character don't constitute PE:
- Storage, display, or delivery of goods/merchandise
- Maintenance of stock for processing by another enterprise
- Purchasing goods or collecting information
- Other activities of preparatory or auxiliary character

**BEPS Action 7 Impact**: Narrowed scope of exceptions:
- Activity must be preparatory or auxiliary in nature
- Cannot be core business activity
- Anti-fragmentation rule: Related entities' activities aggregated

**Service Company Application**:
- **Equipment depot**: Storage of drilling equipment or service tools (preparatory/auxiliary)
- **Supply base**: Offshore supply and logistics coordination (borderline - may constitute PE if substantial)
- **Administrative office**: Purely administrative support (preparatory/auxiliary)
- **Training facility**: Training personnel for deployment elsewhere (preparatory/auxiliary if not core business)

**Post-BEPS Analysis**: Each activity assessed to determine if preparatory/auxiliary considering:
- Essential and significant part of enterprise's business
- Activities complement core business activities
- Standalone economic significance

### 2.5 Profit Attribution to Service PE

**OECD Authorized OECD Approach (AOA)**: Under the 2010 OECD Report on Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments, the PE is treated as a functionally separate enterprise for profit attribution purposes.

**Two-Step Process**:

**Step 1 - Hypothesization**: Determine functions performed, assets used, risks assumed by PE as if separate enterprise.

**Step 2 - Profit Determination**: Calculate profits attributable to PE based on:
- Functions performed at PE location
- Assets employed by PE
- Risks assumed by PE
- Arm's length remuneration for functions

**Service PE Profit Attribution Methods**:

**Direct Method**: Calculate revenue and costs directly attributable to services performed in source country:
- Service revenue from in-country projects
- Direct costs: Personnel, equipment, consumables deployed in-country
- Indirect costs: Allocated headquarters costs, management charges
- Operating profit margin: Arm's length margin for comparable service activities

**Fractional Apportionment**: Allocate total enterprise profit based on formula:
- Revenue factor: In-country revenue / total revenue
- Payroll factor: In-country payroll / total payroll
- Asset factor: In-country assets / total assets
- Common in jurisdictions without robust transfer pricing infrastructure

**Key Adjustments**:
- **Mobilization/demobilization costs**: Allocation between jurisdictions
- **Standby time**: Whether revenue and costs attributed to PE or home jurisdiction
- **Equipment rental**: Internal charging for equipment provided by head office
- **Technical support**: Charges for home office engineering, supervision
- **Risk adjustment**: PE profit margin adjusted for risk profile

## 3. Analytical Depth - Key Service PE Scenarios

### 3.1 Seismic Vessels and PE Exposure

**Seismic Survey Operations**: Geophysical surveys conducted from vessels (marine seismic) or onshore crews.

**PE Risk Analysis**:
- **Offshore seismic vessel operations**:
  - Fixed place PE: Vessel operating in territorial waters (12 nautical miles from baseline) may constitute fixed place of business if it remains beyond applicable time threshold
  - Construction PE: Seismic survey operations may qualify as "installation" project under some treaty interpretations
  - Service PE: If treaty includes UN Model service PE provision, time spent in territorial waters counts toward 183-day threshold
- **Onshore seismic operations**:
  - Higher PE risk due to physical presence on land
  - Equipment camps and crew accommodations may constitute fixed place
  - Time threshold calculation from commencement to completion

**Time Calculation Complexities**:
- **Territorial waters**: 12 nautical miles from baseline; time vessels spend operating in territorial waters counts toward PE thresholds
- **Continental shelf jurisdiction**: Extended jurisdiction to **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)** (200 nautical miles) under some domestic laws and treaty provisions
- **Multiple surveys**: May be aggregated as connected projects if conducted for same concession area or operator
- **Vessel repositioning**: Transit time between survey locations generally excluded from PE time calculation

**Planning Strategies**:
- Structure contracts to stay below PE thresholds
- Use multiple vessels or crews to segment projects
- Treaty selection: Incorporate through jurisdiction with favorable treaty
- Subcontracting: Prime contractor vs. subcontractor PE exposure differs

### 3.2 Drilling Rig PE Determination

**Drilling Operations**: Exploration drilling, development drilling, workover, and well intervention.

**Offshore Drilling Rigs**:
- **Mobile drilling rigs** (jack-up, semi-submersible, drillship):
  - Fixed place PE: Depends on degree of permanence and connection to seabed
  - Construction PE: If drilling treated as "construction/installation" with time threshold
  - Jurisdictional variations: Some treaties explicitly address drilling rigs
- **Time threshold application**:
  - Commencement: Arrival on location, spud-in, or contract start (varies)
  - Completion: Well completion, rig departure, or contract end
  - Multiple wells: Same concession wells may be aggregated as connected project
  - Standby/weather downtime: Generally included in PE time calculation

**Onshore Drilling**:
- Stronger PE risk due to fixed location on land
- Rig and support equipment create fixed place of business
- Construction PE threshold typically shorter (6 months common)

**Workover and Well Servicing**:
- Shorter duration operations
- May avoid PE threshold if each intervention brief
- Aggregation risk if multiple workovers throughout year

### 3.3 Onshore vs. Offshore Service PE

**Jurisdictional Reach**:
- **Onshore**: Full territorial jurisdiction; domestic tax law and treaties apply
- **Offshore**:
  - Territorial waters (12 nm): Full sovereignty; PE principles apply
  - Continental shelf/EEZ: Sovereign rights for resource exploitation; PE taxation may extend under domestic law
  - Treaty interpretation: Whether activities on continental shelf covered by Article 5

**PE Threshold Differences**:
- **Onshore services**: Lower thresholds common due to clear territorial presence
- **Offshore services**: Higher thresholds or exemptions in some treaties
- **Treaty-specific provisions**: Some treaties specifically address offshore activities

**Example - UK Continental Shelf**:
- UK extends tax jurisdiction to continental shelf activities
- PE created if business carried on in UK or UK continental shelf
- Treaty relief available where treaty includes continental shelf in territory definition

### 3.4 Secondment vs. Independent Contractor Distinction

**Critical for PE Determination**: Whether personnel are employees of service company or seconded to operator.

**Secondment**:
- **Definition**: Service company employees placed under direction and control of client operator
- **PE implications**:
  - Operator may have PE exposure (dependent agent PE if seconded personnel conclude contracts)
  - Service company less likely to have PE (no fixed place controlled by service company)
  - Transfer pricing: Arm's length charge for seconded personnel

**Independent Contractor**:
- **Definition**: Service company retains direction and control over its personnel
- **PE implications**:
  - Service company has PE exposure through its personnel and activities
  - Fixed place PE or service PE likely if threshold exceeded
  - Higher profit margin justified (bears risk, controls operations)

**Distinction Factors**:
- **Supervision and control**: Who directs day-to-day activities
- **Tools and equipment**: Provided by service company or operator
- **Risk**: Who bears operational and commercial risk
- **Contractual terms**: Service contract vs. personnel supply agreement
- **Economic substance**: Actual operational control vs. contractual formalities

**Tax Consequences**:
- **Secondment**: Operator PE risk; lower service margin (cost-plus)
- **Independent contractor**: Service company PE risk; higher service margin (profit markup)

### 3.5 Treaty Shopping by Service Companies

**Objective**: Structure service company incorporation to access favorable treaty network and minimize PE exposure.

**Common Structures**:
- **European service hubs**: Netherlands, UK, Luxembourg incorporation
  - Extensive treaty network with reduced PE thresholds
  - Participation exemption for foreign profits
  - Substance requirements: Real offices, management, employees

- **Regional hubs**: Singapore, UAE, Cyprus for Asia/Middle East/Africa
  - Favorable treaties with resource-rich countries
  - Lower PE thresholds or higher service PE duration limits
  - Tax incentives for service income

**BEPS Anti-Treaty Shopping Measures**:
- **Principal Purpose Test (PPT)**: Denies treaty benefits if obtaining treaty benefits was one of the principal purposes of the arrangement or transaction
- **Limitation on Benefits (LOB)**: Requires taxpayer to satisfy objective tests demonstrating sufficient connection to treaty jurisdiction (primarily used in US treaties)
- **Substance requirements**: OECD BEPS Action 6 minimum standards require genuine economic presence in treaty jurisdiction

**Legitimate Tax Planning**:
- Genuine commercial substance in hub jurisdiction
- Real decision-making and risk management at hub
- Business rationale beyond tax benefits (regional coordination, talent pool)

**Indicators of Substance**:
- Qualified employees and management
- Office premises and facilities
- Strategic decision-making in hub jurisdiction
- Real economic activity (contract negotiation, client management)

### 3.6 Withholding Tax vs. PE Taxation Trade-off

**Taxation Alternatives** for cross-border service income:

**Withholding Tax (WHT)**:
- **Gross basis**: Tax applied to gross service fees without deduction for costs
- **Rate**: Typically 10-25% under domestic law; may be reduced by applicable tax treaty
- **Treaty provision**: Article 7 (Business Profits) if no PE exists; Article 12 (Royalties) if technical services are classified as royalties or fees for technical services
- **Advantages**: Simple compliance mechanism; no requirement to file corporate tax return; definite liability determined at payment
- **Disadvantages**: Tax calculated on gross revenue basis with no expense deductions allowed

**PE Taxation**:
- **Net basis**: Tax applied to net profits attributable to PE (revenue minus allowable expenses)
- **Rate**: Standard **Corporate Income Tax (CIT)** rate (typically 20-35% depending on jurisdiction)
- **Compliance**: File annual tax return, maintain local books and records, prepare transfer pricing documentation
- **Advantages**: Expense deductions allowed; may result in significantly lower effective tax if profit margin is low
- **Disadvantages**: Complex compliance requirements; transfer pricing scrutiny and documentation burden; higher audit risk

**Economic Comparison**:

If **service margin > (WHT rate / CIT rate)**: PE taxation likely more favorable

Example:
- Service revenue: $10 million
- Direct costs: $8 million
- Profit margin: 20% ($2 million)
- CIT rate: 30%
- WHT rate: 10%

**Scenario 1 - Withholding Tax**:
Tax = $10 million × 10% = **$1 million**

**Scenario 2 - PE Taxation**:
Tax = $2 million × 30% = **$600,000**

**Result**: PE taxation more favorable when margin is low relative to WHT rate.

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **High-margin services**: WHT may be preferable (avoid PE)
- **Low-margin services**: PE taxation beneficial (claim expense deductions)
- **Loss positions**: PE allows losses (potentially carried forward)
- **Compliance burden**: WHT simpler for short-term engagements

## 4. Application Methodology

### 4.1 Service Company PE Analysis Framework

**Step-by-Step PE Risk Assessment**:

**Step 1 - Identify Applicable Treaty**:
- Determine service company's tax residence jurisdiction
- Identify treaty between residence and source country (if any)
- Review treaty provisions: Article 5 (PE definition), Article 7 (Business Profits)

**Step 2 - Analyze Physical Presence**:
- Fixed place of business: Office, facility, project site
- Equipment and assets deployed in source country
- Duration and continuity of presence

**Step 3 - Apply PE Tests**:
- **Fixed place PE**: Premises at disposal, permanence, business activities conducted
- **Construction/installation PE**: Time threshold, connected projects
- **Service PE** (if applicable): Personnel presence, time threshold, same/connected project
- **Dependent agent PE**: Agent authority, habitual exercise, independence

**Step 4 - Consider Exceptions**:
- Preparatory/auxiliary activities (Article 5(4))
- Independent agent (Article 5(6))
- Specific exclusions in bilateral treaty

**Step 5 - Determine Profit Attribution**:
- If PE exists: Calculate profits attributable to PE under Authorized OECD Approach (AOA) or domestic law profit attribution rules
- Transfer pricing analysis: Determine arm's length remuneration for functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed by PE
- Documentation: Maintain contemporaneous records and transfer pricing documentation supporting profit allocation

### 4.2 Service PE Time Tracking Framework

**Robust Time Tracking** essential for PE threshold management:

**Time Tracking System Components**:

| **Element** | **Tracking Requirement** | **Documentation** |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Personnel** | Name, role, nationality, arrival/departure dates | Immigration records, timesheets |
| **Projects** | Project code, client, location, contract dates | Service contracts, purchase orders |
| **Daily presence** | Location (territorial waters, onshore, offshore), activity | Daily reports, GPS logs (vessels) |
| **Aggregation** | Same or connected projects, related party services | Contract analysis, organizational chart |
| **Threshold monitoring** | Running totals, 12-month rolling period | Dashboard, alerts at 75% threshold |

**Best Practices**:
- **Real-time tracking**: Daily or weekly updates, not retrospective
- **Multiple calendar views**: Calendar year, rolling 12-month, fiscal year
- **Project aggregation rules**: Define "same or connected project" criteria
- **Buffer management**: Target 80% of threshold to allow margin for error
- **Related party coordination**: Consolidate time for economically connected entities

**Common Errors**:
- Counting only billable time (vs. all presence time)
- Ignoring mobilization/demobilization periods
- Failing to aggregate connected projects
- Using calendar year instead of rolling 12-month period

### 4.3 Profit Attribution for Service PE

**Authorized OECD Approach (AOA) Application**:

**Step 1 - Functional and Factual Analysis**:
- **Functions**: Technical services, equipment provision, supervision, project management
- **Assets**: Rigs, vessels, specialized equipment, intellectual property (proprietary technology)
- **Risks**: Operational risks, equipment damage, client credit risk, regulatory compliance

**Step 2 - Assign Functions, Assets, and Risks to PE**:
- **Significant people functions**: Key personnel performing significant functions allocated to PE
- **Assets**: Equipment physically located in source country attributed to PE
- **Risks**: Risk management and control functions determine risk allocation

**Step 3 - Determine Arm's Length Remuneration**:
- **Revenue**: Service fees from in-country projects (direct attribution)
- **Direct costs**: Personnel deployed, equipment costs, consumables, subcontractors
- **Indirect costs**: Allocated headquarters costs (management, technical support, HR, finance)
  - Allocation keys: Revenue, headcount, time spent
- **Profit margin**: Arm's length margin for comparable service activities
  - Comparables: Independent service companies providing similar services
  - Transfer pricing methods: TNMM (most common), Cost Plus, Profit Split

**Step 4 - Calculate Taxable Income**:
- Operating profit attributed to PE
- Interest deductions (if applicable, subject to thin capitalization rules)
- Tax depreciation for PE assets
- **Effective tax rate calculation**: PE tax / PE profits

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Transfer pricing documentation (master file, local file)
- Functional analysis supporting profit attribution
- Comparability analysis and benchmarking study
- Intercompany agreements (service agreements, cost sharing)

## 5. Worked Examples

### 5.1 Example 1: Drilling Services Company - Construction PE vs. Service PE Analysis

**Facts**:
- **DrillCo**: Offshore drilling contractor incorporated in Norway
- **Operations**: Provides jack-up drilling rig for exploration drilling offshore Indonesia
- **Contract**: 8-month contract with IndonesianCo (local operator)
  - Well 1: 4 months (January - April 2024)
  - Mobilization/standby: 1 month (May 2024)
  - Well 2: 3 months (June - August 2024)
- **Treaty**: Norway-Indonesia Tax Treaty includes:
  - Article 5(3): Construction PE if project exceeds 120 days
  - No specific service PE provision (follows OECD Model)
- **Revenue**: $20 million total contract value
- **Costs**: Rig operating costs $14 million; corporate overhead $2 million

**Issue 1: Does DrillCo have a PE in Indonesia?**

**Analysis - Fixed Place of Business PE (Article 5(1))**:
- Jack-up rig stationed at fixed location on continental shelf
- Connected to seabed during drilling operations
- Degree of permanence: 8 months (significant duration)
- Business conducted: Core drilling operations

**Conclusion**: Likely creates **fixed place PE** under Article 5(1) if treaty extends to continental shelf (common in energy treaties).

**Analysis - Construction PE (Article 5(3))**:
- **Activity**: Drilling operations may qualify as "installation" or "assembly" project
- **Duration calculation**:
  - Well 1: 120 days (January - April)
  - Mobilization/standby: 30 days (May)
  - Well 2: 90 days (June - August)
  - **Total: 240 days**
- **Treaty threshold**: 120 days
- **Connected project test**: Both wells for same operator, same concession block
  - Wells drilled consecutively as part of single exploration program
  - Commercially and geographically coherent
  - **Conclusion**: Connected project

**Conclusion**: **Construction PE exists** - duration (240 days) exceeds treaty threshold (120 days).

**Time Tracking Summary**:

| **Period** | **Activity** | **Days** | **Cumulative** | **PE Status** |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Jan-Apr 2024 | Well 1 drilling | 120 | 120 | At threshold |
| May 2024 | Mobilization/standby | 30 | 150 | **PE created** |
| Jun-Aug 2024 | Well 2 drilling | 90 | 240 | PE continues |

**Issue 2: Profit Attribution to Indonesian PE**

**Step 1 - Functional Analysis**:
- **Functions**: Drilling operations, rig crew management, equipment maintenance, technical supervision
- **Assets**: Jack-up rig (value $200 million), drilling equipment, spare parts inventory
- **Risks**: Operational risks, equipment damage, well control, environmental compliance

**Step 2 - Revenue and Cost Attribution**:
- **Revenue**: $20 million (100% attributable to Indonesian operations)
- **Direct costs**:
  - Rig operating costs: $14 million (personnel, fuel, consumables, maintenance)
  - All incurred for Indonesian drilling operations: **$14 million**
- **Indirect costs** (Norwegian headquarters):
  - Corporate overhead: $2 million
  - Functions: Contract management, technical support, finance, HR
  - **Allocation**: Based on revenue ratio
    - Assume DrillCo total annual revenue: $100 million
    - Indonesian operations: $20 million = 20% of total revenue
    - Allocated overhead: $2 million × 20% = **$400,000**

**Step 3 - Profit Calculation**:
- Revenue: $20,000,000
- Direct costs: ($14,000,000)
- Allocated overhead: ($400,000)
- **Operating profit: $5,600,000**
- **Profit margin: 28%** (typical for offshore drilling contractors)

**Step 4 - Indonesian Tax Liability**:
- Taxable profit: $5,600,000
- Indonesian corporate tax rate: 22%
- **Indonesian tax: $1,232,000**

**Step 5 - Norway Tax Treatment**:
- DrillCo reports total income in Norway
- Foreign tax credit for Indonesian tax paid: $1,232,000
- Norwegian tax rate: 22% (corporate) + 56% (offshore petroleum tax) = 78% on petroleum income
  - However, drilling contractor not subject to offshore petroleum tax (applies to production)
  - Standard corporate rate applies: 22%
- Norwegian tax on $5,600,000: $1,232,000
- Foreign tax credit: ($1,232,000)
- **Net Norwegian tax: $0** (full credit available)

**Alternative - WHT Scenario** (if no PE):
- If DrillCo structured to avoid PE (e.g., contract < 120 days, separate entities for each well)
- Indonesia may impose WHT on service fees (if domestic law and treaty allow)
- Typical WHT rate: 10% under treaty (Article 7/12)
- WHT tax: $20 million × 10% = **$2,000,000**
- **Higher tax burden** than PE taxation ($1,232,000)

**Conclusion**: PE taxation more favorable due to cost deductions (28% margin vs. 10% WHT on gross).

### 5.2 Example 2: Technical Services Company with Seconded Personnel - Dependent Agent PE Analysis

**Facts**:
- **TechServices Inc.**: US-incorporated engineering services company
- **Services**: Reservoir engineering, production optimization, facilities design
- **Client**: BrazilOil (Brazilian state oil company)
- **Structure**:
  - **Service Agreement**: TechServices provides technical advisory services
  - **Personnel**: 6 engineers seconded to BrazilOil office in Rio de Janeiro
  - **Duration**: 18 months (January 2024 - June 2025)
  - **Local Coordinator**: BrazilRep (Brazilian company) acts as local representative
    - Negotiates contract terms and amendments
    - Coordinates personnel deployment
    - Invoices BrazilOil on behalf of TechServices (10% commission)
- **Revenue**: $3.6 million ($200k per month)
- **Costs**:
  - Engineer salaries and benefits: $2.4 million
  - BrazilRep commission: $360,000
  - US overhead allocation: $240,000

**Treaty**: US-Brazil Tax Treaty (hypothetical provisions):
- Article 5(1): Fixed place PE
- Article 5(3): Construction PE at 6 months
- Article 5(5): Dependent agent PE (person with authority to conclude contracts)
- **No service PE provision** (follows OECD Model)

**Issue 1: Does TechServices have a PE in Brazil?**

**Analysis 1 - Fixed Place PE (Article 5(1))**:
- **No office**: TechServices has no office or facility in Brazil
- **Seconded personnel**: Work at BrazilOil's office, not at TechServices' disposal
- **Conclusion**: **No fixed place PE** - no premises at TechServices' disposal

**Analysis 2 - Service PE**:
- **Not applicable**: US-Brazil treaty follows OECD Model (no service PE provision)

**Analysis 3 - Dependent Agent PE (Article 5(5))**:

**Criteria**:
1. **Person acting on behalf of enterprise**: BrazilRep acts on behalf of TechServices
2. **Authority to conclude contracts**:
   - BrazilRep negotiates and amends contract terms
   - Signs amendments and change orders binding TechServices
   - **Conclusion**: Has authority to conclude contracts
3. **Habitually exercises authority**:
   - Over 18-month period, BrazilRep negotiates multiple amendments (scope changes, rate adjustments)
   - Regular exercise of contracting authority
   - **Conclusion**: Habitual exercise
4. **Independent agent exception (Article 5(6))**:
   - BrazilRep is economically dependent (10% commission = substantial portion of revenue)
   - BrazilRep activities devoted substantially to TechServices (60% of BrazilRep revenue from TechServices)
   - **Conclusion**: NOT independent agent (fails independence test)

**Conclusion**: **Dependent Agent PE exists** through BrazilRep.

**Issue 2: Profit Attribution to Brazilian PE**

**Approach**: Dependent agent PE attribution based on profits from Brazilian activities coordinated by agent.

**Step 1 - Determine PE Revenue**:
- All Brazilian service revenue: **$3.6 million** (18 months × $200k)

**Step 2 - Direct Costs**:
- Engineer salaries/benefits (6 engineers in Brazil): $2.4 million
- **Note**: Personnel physically in Brazil but legally seconded
  - Transfer pricing: Secondment charge to BrazilOil should be at arm's length
  - Arm's length markup on personnel costs: 5-15% for secondment
  - Applied markup: 10%
  - Arm's length secondment charge: $2.4 million × 1.10 = **$2.64 million**
  - **Issue**: Actual charge is $3.6 million, implying 50% markup
  - Transfer pricing adjustment potential

**Step 3 - BrazilRep Commission**:
- Commission paid to dependent agent: $360,000
- **Transfer pricing analysis**:
  - Arm's length commission for contract negotiation and coordination: 3-5% of contract value
  - Actual commission: 10% ($360,000)
  - **Potential adjustment**: Reduce to 5% = $180,000
  - Excess commission: $180,000 (may be disallowed or attributed to PE profit)

**Step 4 - Allocated Overhead**:
- US headquarters costs: $240,000
- Functions: Strategic management, technical supervision, quality control
- Allocation reasonable: 6.7% of revenue

**Step 5 - Profit Calculation (Actual Amounts)**:
- Revenue: $3,600,000
- Engineer costs: ($2,400,000)
- BrazilRep commission: ($360,000)
- US overhead: ($240,000)
- **Operating profit: $600,000**
- **Profit margin: 16.7%**

**Step 6 - Transfer Pricing Adjustment Scenario**:

If Brazilian tax authority adjusts BrazilRep commission to arm's length (5%):
- Allowable commission: $3.6 million × 5% = $180,000
- Disallowed commission: $180,000
- Adjusted profit: $600,000 + $180,000 = **$780,000**
- **Adjusted margin: 21.7%**

**Step 7 - Brazilian Tax Liability**:
- Taxable profit: $600,000 (or $780,000 if adjusted)
- Brazilian corporate tax rate: 34% (25% IRPJ + 9% CSLL)
- **Brazilian tax: $204,000** (or $265,200 if adjusted)

**Step 8 - US Tax Treatment**:
- TechServices reports worldwide income in US
- Foreign tax credit for Brazilian tax: $204,000
- US tax rate: 21%
- US tax on $600,000: $126,000
- Foreign tax credit: ($126,000)
- **Excess foreign tax credit**: $78,000 (Brazilian tax > US tax)
  - Can be carried back 1 year or forward 10 years against other foreign source income

**Alternative Structure - Avoid Dependent Agent PE**:

**Option 1**: Use independent agent (not economically dependent)
- BrazilRep earns <10% of revenue from TechServices
- BrazilRep has multiple unrelated clients
- Commission reduced to arm's length (3-5%)

**Option 2**: Eliminate agent authority to conclude contracts
- BrazilRep provides coordination only (no contracting authority)
- All contracts signed by TechServices US personnel
- BrazilRep acts as facilitator, not agent with binding authority

**Option 3**: Establish Brazilian subsidiary
- TechBrazil incorporated in Brazil (transparent PE structure)
- Benefits:
  - Clear PE structure and profit attribution
  - May access Brazilian tax incentives for technical services
  - Substance requirements satisfied
- Drawbacks:
  - Full Brazilian compliance (corporate registration, accounting, payroll)
  - Transfer pricing documentation for US-Brazil transactions

**Profit Attribution Comparison**:

| **Scenario** | **Brazilian Tax** | **US Tax** | **Total Tax** | **Effective Rate** |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **No PE** (WHT 15%) | $540,000 | $126,000 | $666,000 | 18.5% |
| **Dependent Agent PE** | $204,000 | $0 (excess credit) | $204,000 | 5.7% |
| **Adjusted for TP** | $265,200 | $0 (excess credit) | $265,200 | 7.4% |

**Conclusion**: Dependent Agent PE results in **lower total tax** than WHT scenario, primarily because:
1. Brazilian tax on net profit (34% on $600k) < WHT on gross (15% on $3.6m)
2. Low profit margin (16.7%) makes net basis taxation favorable
3. Excess foreign tax credit indicates Brazilian tax rate (34%) exceeds US rate (21%)

**Planning Considerations**:
- If profit margin were higher (>44%), WHT might be preferable
- Independent agent structure could avoid PE but increases agent cost
- Brazilian subsidiary provides certainty but increases compliance burden
- Transfer pricing documentation critical to defend profit allocation

## 6. Recent Developments

### 6.1 BEPS 2.0 Impact on Service Companies

**Pillar Two (Global Minimum Tax)**: The OECD/G20 BEPS 2.0 Pillar Two framework (agreed October 2021, implementation from 2024) applies to service companies with consolidated group revenues exceeding EUR 750 million:
- **Top-up tax**: Calculated on a jurisdictional basis to ensure minimum 15% effective tax rate
- **Impact on service hubs**: Service companies operating through low-tax jurisdictions (United Arab Emirates, Singapore) may face top-up tax under the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR)
- **PE implications**: Pillar Two utilizes PE profit allocation for determining jurisdictional effective tax rates

**Pillar One (Amount A)**: Not directly applicable to most service companies, as Amount A focuses on large consumer-facing multinational enterprises (MNEs with revenues exceeding EUR 20 billion). However, **Amount B** provides standardized baseline returns for marketing and distribution functions, potentially informing benchmarks for service PE profit attribution analyses.

### 6.2 OECD BEPS Action 7 - Preventing PE Avoidance

**Specific Anti-Avoidance Rule (SAAR) for Contract Splitting**:
- **Issue**: Service companies artificially splitting contracts to remain below construction PE time thresholds
- **Solution**: **MLI Article 14** (not Article 13) addresses contract splitting between closely related enterprises - applies Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to deny PE threshold benefits if principal purpose of contract splitting was to avoid PE status under Article 5(3)
- **Impact**: Multiple short-term contracts may be aggregated and treated as single PE-creating project if:
  - Contracts between same enterprise (or closely related enterprises) and same client
  - Commercially coherent project with close geographic and temporal connection
  - Principal purpose was to avoid PE threshold
- **Implementation note**: Article 14 is an optional (not minimum standard) provision under the MLI; many countries opted out or reserved positions

**Anti-Fragmentation Rule** (Article 5(4.1) of 2017 OECD Model):
- **Issue**: Enterprises fragmenting complementary business activities across multiple closely related entities to artificially claim Article 5(4) preparatory/auxiliary exceptions
- **Solution**: Introduced in 2017 OECD Model update - aggregates complementary functions of closely related enterprises to determine whether combined activities exceed preparatory/auxiliary threshold
- **Purpose**: Prevents enterprises from splitting cohesive business operations into smaller components to argue each constitutes merely preparatory/auxiliary activity
- **Impact**: Service company groups cannot fragment integrated operations (e.g., separating equipment supply, technical services, and logistics support across different entities) to avoid PE creation if combined activities constitute core business functions

### 6.3 Digital Services and Remote Service Delivery

**Remote Technical Services**: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated adoption of remote service delivery models including digital oilfield technologies and remote production monitoring systems.

**PE Implications of Remote Service Delivery**:
- **No physical presence**: Services delivered remotely from home jurisdiction generally do not create PE in source country absent physical presence
- **Equipment presence**: Remote monitoring equipment, sensors, or automated systems physically located in source country may create fixed place of business PE
- **Withholding tax exposure**: Source countries increasingly impose withholding tax (WHT) on payments for digital and technical services even in absence of PE

**Significant Economic Presence (SEP)**: Some jurisdictions have introduced SEP concepts as alternative nexus tests:
- **India**: SEP provisions effective from April 2021 with thresholds of INR 20 million (approximately USD 240,000-275,000) aggregate payments from Indian customers, or systematic and continuous interaction with 300,000 or more Indian users
- **Nigeria**: SEP provisions introduced in Finance Act 2020, establishing nexus based on revenue thresholds and digital/online presence (implementation framework under development)
- **Concept**: PE created by significant economic presence even without traditional physical presence
- **Factors**: Revenue derived from source country, user base size, data collection and utilization
- **Energy sector impact**: Limited direct application, as SEP provisions primarily target digital economy business models rather than traditional energy services

### 6.4 Increased Scrutiny of Service Company Structures

**Tax Authority Focus Areas**:
- **Profit attribution**: Transfer pricing audits challenging service PE profit margins
- **Time tracking**: Audits of PE threshold calculations (secondments, site visits, connected projects)
- **Related party services**: Whether services provide genuine value or artificial profit shifting
- **Treaty shopping**: Substance requirements for service hubs claiming treaty benefits

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Real-time time tracking and project monitoring
- Contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation
- Functional analysis supporting profit attribution
- Substance evidence for treaty residence claims

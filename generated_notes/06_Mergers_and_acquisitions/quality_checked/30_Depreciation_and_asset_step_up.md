## Topic 30: Mergers and Acquisitions
### Depreciation and Asset Step Up

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Value of Tax Basis

In oil and gas acquisitions, the **tax basis** of acquired assets determines the quantum and timing of future **depreciation**, **depletion**, and **amortization** deductions. A higher tax basis translates directly into:

- Greater annual tax deductions
- Lower effective tax rate
- Enhanced after-tax cash flow
- Increased transaction value

The ability to obtain a **stepped-up tax basis** (increasing the basis from the seller's historical cost to the purchase price) can add 10-25% to the present value of an acquisition, making it one of the most significant tax value drivers in M&A transactions.

### 1.2 Asset Step-Up: Definition and Mechanics

An **asset step-up** occurs when the purchaser obtains a **tax basis** in acquired assets equal to their **fair market value** or **purchase price allocation**, rather than inheriting the seller's historical basis.

**Example:**
- Seller's tax basis in oil production equipment: **$20 million** (original cost $50M, less accumulated depreciation $30M)
- Purchase price allocated to equipment: **$60 million**
- **Step-up:** Buyer's basis = **$60 million** (not $20 million)
- **Incremental basis: $40 million**

This additional $40 million basis can be depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life, generating substantial tax savings.

### 1.3 Examination Focus

Candidates must understand:
- Conditions under which step-up is available
- Asset classification and depreciation methods
- Purchase price allocation (PPA) principles
- Interaction with **Section 1245/1250 recapture** rules
- Goodwill and intangible assets treatment
- Cross-border and treaty implications

## 2. Conditions for Asset Step-Up

### 2.1 Asset Purchase vs. Share Purchase

#### 2.1.1 Asset Purchase → Step-Up Available

When a buyer acquires **specific assets** (petroleum licenses, drilling rigs, pipelines, production facilities), the buyer establishes a **new tax basis** equal to:

- **Purchase price** allocated to each asset, **plus**
- **Transaction costs** directly attributable to asset acquisition (legal fees, due diligence, transfer taxes)

**Statutory Basis:**
- **US**: US Internal Revenue Code Section 1012 - basis = cost
- **UK**: Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (TCGA 1992), Section 38 - acquisition cost
- **Australia**: Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997), Division 110 - cost base includes acquisition expenditure

#### 2.1.2 Share Purchase → No Step-Up (General Rule)

Acquiring shares in a company that owns assets results in:

- **No change** in the target company's tax basis in its assets
- Buyer's basis is in the **shares**, not the underlying assets
- **Historical depreciation** continues unchanged

**Exception - US Internal Revenue Code Section 338 Election:**
Under **US Internal Revenue Code Section 338**, a buyer acquiring 80%+ of a corporation's stock can elect to treat the transaction as an **deemed asset purchase** for tax purposes:

- Target is treated as selling all assets at FMV (triggering gain recognition)
- Buyer obtains stepped-up basis in assets
- **Rarely used** due to seller-level tax cost (unless seller has losses or is tax-exempt)

### 2.2 Purchase Price Allocation

#### 2.2.1 Allocation Principles

When multiple assets are acquired in a single transaction, the purchase price must be **allocated** among:

- **Tangible assets**: Drilling equipment, production facilities, pipelines, vehicles
- **Intangible assets**: Petroleum licenses, drilling permits, seismic data, customer contracts
- **Natural resources**: Proven and probable reserves
- **Goodwill**: Residual amount after allocating to identified assets

**Tax Rules Governing Allocation:**

**US - US Internal Revenue Code Section 1060 (Applicable Asset Acquisition):**
Requires allocation using the **residual method** under seven asset classes:

| Class | Asset Type | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| I | Cash and cash equivalents | Face value |
| II | Actively traded securities | FMV |
| III | Accounts receivable, mortgages | FMV |
| IV | Inventory, stock-in-trade | FMV |
| V | All assets not in other classes (equipment, buildings, land) | FMV |
| VI | US Internal Revenue Code Section 197 intangibles (licenses, permits, goodwill) | FMV |
| VII | Goodwill and going concern value | **Residual** |

**UK - Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Section 52:**
Allocation based on **market value** of each asset on acquisition date.

**International Financial Reporting Standard 3 (IFRS 3) - Business Combinations:**
For financial reporting, allocation based on **fair value** at acquisition date:
- Tangible assets: Replacement cost or discounted cash flow
- Intangible assets: Relief-from-royalty method, multi-period excess earnings
- Reserves: Discounted future cash flows (proved reserves)

**Tax vs. Accounting Basis:**
Tax authorities may challenge allocations that deviate significantly from IFRS fair values, particularly if they:
- Overallocate to high-depreciation assets
- Undervalue goodwill to accelerate deductions
- Lack supporting valuation reports

#### 2.2.2 Valuation Methodologies

**Tangible Assets:**
- **Cost approach**: Replacement cost new, less physical depreciation
- **Market approach**: Comparable sales of similar equipment
- **Income approach**: Discounted cash flows attributable to the asset

**Petroleum Reserves:**
- **Reserve-based valuation**: Net present value of proved developed producing (PDP), proved developed non-producing (PDNP), and proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves
- **Discount rates**: Typically 10-15% for risked reserves
- **Price assumptions**: Forward curve or long-term price deck

**Intangible Assets:**
- **Licenses and permits**: Relief-from-royalty method (royalty rate × discounted revenue)
- **Seismic data**: Cost approach (replacement cost)
- **Customer relationships**: Multi-period excess earnings method

**Goodwill:**
- **Residual**: Purchase price less sum of FMV of identifiable assets

## 3. Depreciation Methods and Asset Lives

### 3.1 Asset Classification

Oil and gas assets are classified into different categories, each with specific **depreciation methods** and **recovery periods**:

#### 3.1.1 Tangible Depreciable Property

**US Tax Classification (MACRS):**

| Asset | Recovery Period | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Drilling equipment, pumps, compressors | **7 years** | 200% declining balance |
| Production platforms, gathering systems | **7 years** | 200% declining balance |
| Gas pipelines (natural gas distribution) | **15 years** | 150% declining balance |
| Oil pipelines | **7 years** | 200% declining balance |
| Offshore structures | **7 years** | 200% declining balance |
| Buildings and structural components | **39 years** | Straight-line |

**200% Declining Balance:**
- Double depreciation = (2 ÷ recovery period) × book value
- Year 1: (2 ÷ 7) × $100M = $28.57M
- Year 2: (2 ÷ 7) × ($100M - $28.57M) = $20.41M
- Switches to straight-line when that method yields higher deduction

**Bonus Depreciation (US):**
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), bonus depreciation was phasing down:
- **2022 and earlier**: 100% immediate expensing
- **2023**: 80%
- **2024**: 60%
- **2025**: 40% (for property placed in service before January 20, 2025)
- **2025 onwards** (from January 20, 2025): 100% restored under the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act
- Applies to new and used property with recovery period ≤ 20 years
- Significant planning tool to accelerate deductions

#### 3.1.2 Depletion (Natural Resources)

**Cost Depletion:**
Basis in mineral property is recovered proportionally as reserves are extracted:

**Formula:**
- **Cost depletion per unit = (Adjusted basis in property ÷ Total recoverable units) × Units sold during year**

**Example:**
- Basis in proven reserves: $100 million
- Total recoverable reserves: 50 million barrels
- Production in Year 1: 3 million barrels
- **Cost depletion = ($100M ÷ 50M bbls) × 3M bbls = $6 million**

**Percentage Depletion (US - Limited Availability):**
Independent producers and royalty owners can elect **percentage depletion** at **15% of gross income** from the property, subject to:
- **Limit**: Cannot exceed **100% of taxable income** from the property (before depletion)
- **Depletable quantity limit**: 1,000 bbls/day of oil (or 6,000 Mcf/day of gas) per producer
- **Small producer exception**: Applies to independent producers only (not integrated oil companies)

Percentage depletion can **exceed cost basis**, providing ongoing deductions even after basis is fully recovered.

#### 3.1.3 Intangible Assets

**US Internal Revenue Code Section 197 Intangibles:**
Amortized over **15 years** straight-line:
- Goodwill
- Going concern value
- Licenses, permits, franchises
- Customer lists and contracts
- Covenants not to compete

**Non-Section 197 Intangibles (US):**
Some intangibles are **not subject to 15-year amortization** under US law:
- **Seismic data**: May qualify for immediate expensing under **IDC provisions** or amortized over useful life
- **Software**: 36 months straight-line
- **Self-created intangibles**: Generally not amortizable (e.g., proprietary technology developed internally)

### 3.2 Intangible Drilling Costs (IDCs)

**Definition:**
**Intangible drilling and development costs** are expenditures for drilling and preparing wells for production that have **no salvage value**, including:

- Wages, fuel, repairs
- Hauling and supplies
- Survey and ground clearing
- Drilling mud and chemicals

**Tax Treatment (US):**
- **Domestic wells**: 100% immediately deductible (election to capitalize and amortize over 60 months)
- **Foreign wells**: Must be capitalized and amortized over 10 years (unless §59(e) election made for 5-year amortization)

**Impact on M&A:**
Seller may have **deducted IDCs** as incurred. Upon sale:
- IDC deductions are subject to **recapture as ordinary income** to the extent of prior deductions (similar to depreciation recapture)

---

## 4. Depreciation Recapture

### 4.1 Section 1245 Recapture (Equipment and Tangible Personal Property)

#### 4.1.1 Recapture Rule

When depreciable personal property is sold under **US Internal Revenue Code Section 1245**, **gain is treated as ordinary income** to the extent of **prior depreciation** claimed.

**Formula:**
- **US Internal Revenue Code Section 1245 recapture (ordinary income) = Lesser of:**
  - **(a) Gain realized**, or
  - **(b) Total depreciation claimed**

**Example:**
- Original cost of drilling equipment: **$50 million**
- Accumulated depreciation: **$30 million**
- Adjusted basis: **$20 million**
- Sale price: **$45 million**
- **Gain realized: $45M - $20M = $25 million**

Recapture calculation:
- Lesser of: (a) $25M gain, or (b) $30M prior depreciation = **$25 million**
- **Ordinary income (recapture): $25 million** (taxed at corporate rate, e.g., 25%)
- **Capital gain: $0**

If sale price had been $55 million:
- Gain realized: $55M - $20M = **$35 million**
- Recapture: Lesser of (a) $35M, or (b) $30M = **$30 million ordinary income**
- **Capital gain: $5 million** (excess over original cost)

#### 4.1.2 Impact on Seller's Tax Liability

Depreciation recapture increases seller's tax cost in asset sales:
- **Ordinary income tax rate**: 21-35% (depending on jurisdiction)
- **Capital gains rate**: 15-20% (often lower)

This creates an economic incentive for sellers to prefer **share sales**, where recapture is avoided.

### 4.2 Section 1250 Recapture (Real Property)

For **real property** (buildings, offshore platforms treated as structures) under **US Internal Revenue Code Section 1250**, recapture applies only to **accelerated depreciation** in excess of straight-line depreciation:

**Formula:**
- **US Internal Revenue Code Section 1250 recapture = Gain × (Accelerated depreciation - Straight-line depreciation)**

Since most real property uses **straight-line depreciation**, Section 1250 recapture is **rarely triggered** in oil and gas transactions.

However, **unrecaptured Section 1250 gain** (depreciation on real property) is taxed at **25%** (higher than normal capital gains rate of 15-20%).

---

## 5. Goodwill and Section 197 Intangibles

### 5.1 Goodwill in Oil & Gas Acquisitions

**Goodwill** arises when purchase price exceeds the fair market value of identifiable net assets:

**Purchase Price Allocation:**
- Total purchase price: **$500 million**
- Less: FMV of tangible assets (equipment, facilities): **$200 million**
- Less: FMV of identifiable intangibles (licenses, reserves): **$250 million**
- **Goodwill (residual): $50 million**

**Tax Treatment (US):**
- Goodwill is amortized over **15 years straight-line** under **US Internal Revenue Code Section 197**
- **Annual amortization: $50M ÷ 15 = $3.33 million per year**

### 5.2 Strategic Allocation to Goodwill

Buyers prefer to **minimize goodwill** allocation and **maximize allocation to shorter-lived assets**:

**Preference Ranking (Buyer Perspective):**
| Asset Class | Recovery Period | Tax Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **1. IDCs** | Immediate | Highest (immediate deduction) |
| **2. Equipment (7-year MACRS)** | 7 years | High (fast depreciation) |
| **3. Reserves (cost depletion)** | Production-based | Medium (matches production) |
| **4. Licenses (US IRC Section 197)** | 15 years | Lower (long amortization) |
| **5. Goodwill (US IRC Section 197)** | 15 years | Lowest (residual, slow recovery) |

**Tax Authority Scrutiny:**
Aggressive allocations that minimize goodwill face IRS or HMRC challenges. Taxpayers must support allocations with:
- **Independent appraisals**
- **Market comparables**
- **Discounted cash flow models**

---

## 6. Asset Step-Up in Cross-Border Transactions

### 6.1 Transfer Pricing Considerations

When acquiring assets from a **related party** (e.g., sister company within same group), the purchase price must be **arm's length**:

- **Transfer pricing rules** require documentation supporting fair market value
- Tax authorities may adjust basis if price is not arm's length
- **Penalties** for inadequate documentation

### 6.2 Tax Treaty Impact

Some tax treaties contain provisions affecting capital gains and depreciation on asset sales:

**OECD Model Article 13 (Capital Gains):**
- **Immovable property**: Taxable in country where located
- **Business property of PE**: Taxable in PE country
- **Shares deriving value from immovable property**: May be taxable in source country

**Depreciation Cross-Border:**
- Most countries allow depreciation only on assets **used in domestic trade or business**
- Assets used in foreign PE may not generate deductions in home country

## 7. Worked Examples

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Asset Step-Up and Depreciation Benefit

**Facts:**

Buyer Corp acquires oil production assets from Seller Inc. for **$300 million**. The assets include:

| Asset | Seller's Adjusted Basis | Purchase Price Allocation |
|---|---|---|
| Drilling equipment (7-year MACRS) | $40M | $120M |
| Production facilities (7-year MACRS) | $30M | $100M |
| Gathering pipelines (15-year MACRS) | $20M | $50M |
| Proven reserves (cost depletion) | $10M | $20M |
| Goodwill (Section 197 amortization) | $0 | $10M |
| **Total** | **$100M** | **$300M** |

**Tax rates:**
- Corporate income tax: **25%**
- Discount rate: **10%**

**Required:**

1. Calculate annual depreciation/depletion for Years 1-3 under **Buyer's stepped-up basis**
2. Compare to depreciation Seller was claiming (no step-up scenario)
3. Calculate present value of incremental tax savings from step-up

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Buyer's Annual Depreciation (Years 1-3)**

**Drilling Equipment ($120M, 7-year MACRS, 200% DB):**

MACRS 7-year percentages: 14.29%, 24.49%, 17.49%, 12.49%, 8.93%, 8.92%, 8.93%, 4.46%

| Year | Depreciation |
|---|---|
| 1 | $120M × 14.29% = **$17.15M** |
| 2 | $120M × 24.49% = **$29.39M** |
| 3 | $120M × 17.49% = **$20.99M** |

**Production Facilities ($100M, 7-year MACRS):**

| Year | Depreciation |
|---|---|
| 1 | $100M × 14.29% = **$14.29M** |
| 2 | $100M × 24.49% = **$24.49M** |
| 3 | $100M × 17.49% = **$17.49M** |

**Gathering Pipelines ($50M, 15-year MACRS, 150% DB):**

15-year MACRS percentages: 5%, 9.50%, 8.55%, 7.70%, 6.93%, ...

| Year | Depreciation |
|---|---|
| 1 | $50M × 5% = **$2.50M** |
| 2 | $50M × 9.50% = **$4.75M** |
| 3 | $50M × 8.55% = **$4.28M** |

**Proven Reserves ($20M, cost depletion):**

Assume 10 million barrels of reserves, production of 1 million bbls/year:

- Cost depletion per barrel: $20M ÷ 10M = **$2/bbl**
- **Annual depletion: 1M bbls × $2 = $2M per year**

**Goodwill ($10M, US Internal Revenue Code Section 197 amortization):**

- **Annual amortization: $10M ÷ 15 years = $0.67M per year**

**Total Annual Deductions:**

| Year | Equipment | Facilities | Pipelines | Depletion | Goodwill | **Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $17.15M | $14.29M | $2.50M | $2.00M | $0.67M | **$36.61M** |
| 2 | $29.39M | $24.49M | $4.75M | $2.00M | $0.67M | **$61.30M** |
| 3 | $20.99M | $17.49M | $4.28M | $2.00M | $0.67M | **$45.43M** |

**Part 2: Seller's Historical Depreciation (No Step-Up)**

Based on Seller's adjusted basis of $100M:

Assume assets were partially depreciated, with remaining basis:

| Asset | Remaining Basis | Annual Depreciation |
|---|---|---|
| Drilling equipment | $40M | $40M ÷ 4 years remaining = **$10M** |
| Production facilities | $30M | $30M ÷ 3 years = **$10M** |
| Gathering pipelines | $20M | $20M ÷ 10 years = **$2M** |
| Proven reserves | $10M | $10M ÷ 10M bbls × 1M bbls = **$1M** |
| Goodwill | $0 | $0 |
| **Total** | **$100M** | **$23M per year** |

**Part 3: Incremental Tax Savings**

**Year 1:**
- Additional deductions from step-up: $36.61M - $23M = **$13.61M**
- Tax savings: $13.61M × 25% = **$3.40M**

**Year 2:**
- Additional deductions: $61.30M - $23M = **$38.30M**
- Tax savings: $38.30M × 25% = **$9.58M**

**Year 3:**
- Additional deductions: $45.43M - $23M = **$22.43M**
- Tax savings: $22.43M × 25% = **$5.61M**

**Present Value Calculation (10% discount):**

| Year | Tax Savings | PV Factor (10%) | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3.40M | 0.909 | **$3.09M** |
| 2 | $9.58M | 0.826 | **$7.91M** |
| 3 | $5.61M | 0.751 | **$4.21M** |
| 4-15 | (continue depreciation) | ... | $35M (approx.) |
| **Total PV** | | | **~$50M** |

**Conclusion:**

The asset step-up generates approximately **$50 million in present value** tax savings over the asset lives, representing **16.7% of the $300M purchase price**. This substantial benefit justifies the buyer's preference for asset purchases despite higher seller tax costs.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2: Depreciation Recapture and Asset Step-Up Combined

**Facts:**

Seller Corp is disposing of its offshore oil production platform and related equipment as part of an asset sale. Details:

| Item | Original Cost | Accumulated Depreciation | Adjusted Basis | Sale Price |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Offshore platform** | $80M | $50M | $30M | $90M |
| **Drilling equipment** | $40M | $30M | $10M | $35M |
| **Total** | **$120M** | **$80M** | **$40M** | **$125M** |

**Seller's tax rate:** 25% (corporate income tax)
**Capital gains rate:** 15%

**Buyer will use 7-year MACRS for all assets** (assumes platform qualifies as equipment).

**Required:**

1. Calculate Seller's **depreciation recapture** (ordinary income) and **capital gain**
2. Calculate Seller's **total tax liability** on the sale
3. Calculate Buyer's **Year 1 and Year 2 depreciation** on stepped-up basis
4. Determine **net economic benefit** to buyer from step-up over 7 years (PV at 10%)

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Seller's Recapture and Capital Gain**

**Offshore Platform:**
- Gain realized: $90M - $30M = **$60M**
- US Internal Revenue Code Section 1245 recapture (lesser of gain or accumulated depreciation):
  - Lesser of $60M or $50M = **$50M ordinary income**
- Capital gain (excess over original cost): $90M - $80M original cost = **$10M capital gain**

**Drilling Equipment:**
- Gain realized: $35M - $10M = **$25M**
- US Internal Revenue Code Section 1245 recapture: Lesser of $25M or $30M depreciation = **$25M ordinary income**
- Capital gain: $0 (sale price < original cost)

**Total Recapture and Gains:**
- **Ordinary income (recapture): $50M + $25M = $75M**
- **Capital gain: $10M**

**Part 2: Seller's Tax Liability**

| Item | Amount | Rate | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ordinary income (recapture) | $75M | 25% | **$18.75M** |
| Capital gain | $10M | 15% | **$1.50M** |
| **Total Tax** | | | **$20.25M** |

**Seller's net proceeds:**
- Sale price: $125M
- Less: Tax: ($20.25M)
- **Net proceeds: $104.75M**

**Part 3: Buyer's Depreciation on Stepped-Up Basis**

**Total stepped-up basis: $125M** (purchase price)

Using **7-year MACRS (200% declining balance):**

MACRS percentages: 14.29% (Year 1), 24.49% (Year 2), ...

**Year 1 depreciation:**
- $125M × 14.29% = **$17.86M**

**Year 2 depreciation:**
- $125M × 24.49% = **$30.61M**

**Tax savings:**
- Year 1: $17.86M × 25% = **$4.47M**
- Year 2: $30.61M × 25% = **$7.65M**

**Part 4: Net Economic Benefit (PV over 7 years)**

Total depreciation over 7 years (sum of MACRS): **$125M** (100% recovery)

Compare to Seller's remaining basis if no sale occurred:
- Seller's adjusted basis: **$40M**
- Seller would depreciate $40M over remaining life (assume 4 years): **$10M/year**

**Buyer's incremental depreciation:**
- Total depreciation: $125M (over 7 years)
- Less: Depreciation without step-up: $40M (over 4 years)
- **Incremental: $85M**

**Tax savings from incremental depreciation:**
- $85M × 25% = **$21.25M total tax savings**

**Present value (approximate, using mid-year convention):**
- PV at 10% over 7 years: **~$16M**

**Conclusion:**

The asset step-up provides Buyer with approximately **$16M in present value** tax benefits. However, Seller incurs **$20.25M in taxes** on the sale (largely due to recapture).

**Negotiation Implications:**
- Seller would demand **share sale** structure to avoid $20M tax hit
- If Buyer insists on asset sale, purchase price must increase by ~$15-20M to compensate Seller
- Net economic gain (Buyer's $16M PV benefit less Seller's compensation) may be minimal

**Optimal Solution:**
- Consider **installment sale** or **like-kind exchange** (if available) to defer Seller's tax
- Or negotiate **mixed structure**: some assets, some shares

## 1. Core Framework of Nigeria's Petroleum Fiscal Regime

### 1.1 Statutory Basis and Petroleum Industry Act 2021

Nigeria's petroleum taxation framework underwent transformative reform with the **Petroleum Industry Act 2021 (PIA)**, which received Presidential assent on **16 August 2021**. The PIA consolidated over 16 legacy petroleum laws into a unified legislative framework, fundamentally restructuring Nigeria's upstream fiscal regime to enhance competitiveness, transparency, and investment attractiveness. This reform followed over 20 years of legislative deliberations.

The PIA replaced the previous fragmented regulatory structure with two new regulatory bodies:
- **Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC)**: Technical and commercial regulation of upstream operations, exploration, development, and production
- **Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA)**: Regulation of midstream and downstream activities including refining, transportation, and distribution

**Key Legislative References:**
- Petroleum Industry Act 2021 (PIA) - entered into force August 2021
- Petroleum Profits Tax Act (PPTA), Cap P13 LFN 2004 (as amended) - applies to unconverted licenses
- Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Act, Cap D3 LFN 2004 (as amended by Deep Offshore Act 2019)
- Companies Income Tax Act (CITA), Cap C21 LFN 2004 (as amended)
- Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (NOGICD Act) 2010
- Tertiary Education Trust Fund (Establishment) Act 2011 (as amended)

### 1.2 Dual Fiscal Regime Structure

**Critical Distinction**: Nigeria currently operates TWO parallel tax regimes for upstream petroleum operations:

**1.2.1 Old Regime - Petroleum Profits Tax Act (PPTA)**
Applies to **unconverted licenses**: Existing Oil Prospecting Licenses (OPLs) and Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) granted under pre-PIA legislation continue under PPTA taxation until license expiration, renewal, or voluntary conversion to the PIA framework.

**PPTA Tax Rates:**
- **Joint Venture (JV) operations** with NNPC (post-payback period): **85%** PPT on chargeable profits
- **JV operations** (pre-payback of capitalized pre-production expenditure): **65.75%** PPT
- **Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs)**: **50%** PPT on contractor's profit share

**1.2.2 New Regime - Petroleum Industry Act 2021**
Applies to **new licenses and converted licenses**: Petroleum Prospecting Licenses (PPLs) and Petroleum Mining Leases (PMLs) issued or converted under PIA framework.

**PIA Tax Structure (Dual Taxation):**
- **Hydrocarbon Tax (HT)**: Replaces PPT
  - **30%** on profits from crude oil for Petroleum Mining Leases (PML) in **onshore and shallow water areas**
  - **15%** on profits from crude oil for Petroleum Prospecting Licenses (PPL) in **onshore and shallow water areas**
  - **0%** (exempt) for **deep offshore** petroleum operations
- **Companies Income Tax (CIT)**: **30%** on all petroleum operations (HT is NOT deductible for CIT purposes, creating combined taxation)

**Effective Tax Rates Under PIA:**
- Onshore/Shallow Water (PML): 30% HT + 30% CIT = **60% combined**
- Onshore/Shallow Water (PPL): 15% HT + 30% CIT = **45% combined**
- Deep Offshore: 0% HT + 30% CIT = **30%** CIT only

### 1.3 Multiple Fiscal Arrangement Types

The PIA recognizes three primary upstream fiscal arrangements:

**Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs)**
Applicable to deep offshore and frontier acreage, where the government retains resource ownership and shares production with contractors after cost recovery.

**Profit Sharing Contracts (Profit-PSCs)**
Mechanism combining royalty, tax, and profit sharing elements for new arrangements.

**Joint Venture (JV) Arrangements**
Traditional arrangements where Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd) holds participating interests with international oil companies.

## 2. Technical Fiscal Rules

### 2.1 Royalty Rates by Water Depth and Production

**Table 1: Royalty Rates Under PIA 2021**

| Location/Water Depth | Oil Royalty Rate | Gas Royalty Rate |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Onshore | 15% | 5% (export) / 2.5% (domestic) |
| Shallow Water (0-100m) | 12.5% | 5% (export) / 2.5% (domestic) |
| Deep Water (100-200m) | 7.5% | 5% (export) / 2.5% (domestic) |
| Deep Offshore (>200m) - Production >50,000 bpd | 7.5% | 5% (export) / 2.5% (domestic) |
| Deep Offshore (>200m) - Production ≤50,000 bpd | 5% | 5% (export) / 2.5% (domestic) |
| Frontier Basins | 7.5% | 5% (export) / 2.5% (domestic) |

Royalties are calculated on **gross production valued at market price** (typically dated Brent crude adjusted for quality and location differentials).

### 2.2 Price-Based Royalty Adjustments (Deep Offshore Act 2019)

The **Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract (Amendment) Act 2019** introduced price-based sliding scale royalties applicable when crude prices exceed USD 20/barrel:

| Oil Price Range ($/bbl) | Additional Royalty | Total Effective Royalty Rate |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| $0 - $20 | 0% | Base rate only |
| Above $20 to $60 | +2.5% | Base rate + 2.5% |
| Above $60 to $100 | +4% | Base rate + 4% |
| Above $100 to $150 | +8% | Base rate + 8% |
| Above $150 | +10% | Base rate + 10% |

These price-based adjustments apply to deep offshore and frontier acreages and increase government take during high price periods.

### 2.3 Additional Fiscal Levies

**Tertiary Education Tax (TET):** Originally 2% of assessable profits under Tertiary Education Trust Fund Act (as amended), increased to **2.5%** under Finance Act 2021, further increased to **3%** for accounting periods ending on or after 1 September 2023. TET is no longer tax deductible under PIA.

**Withholding Taxes (WHT):**
- Dividends: 10% (may be reduced by tax treaty)
- Interest: 10% (may be reduced by tax treaty)
- Royalties/Technical fees: 10%
- Services to non-residents: 10%

**Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Levy:** 3% of annual budget for companies operating in onshore and shallow water areas, funding community development in producing regions.

## 3. Analytical Depth: Incentive Mechanisms and Compliance

### 3.1 Deep Offshore Fiscal Advantages

The PIA creates significant fiscal differentiation favoring deep offshore development to incentivize investment in technically challenging and capital-intensive projects:

**Comparative Analysis:**
- **Royalty rates**: 5-7.5% (deep offshore) vs. 15% (onshore)
- **Hydrocarbon Tax**: 0% (deep offshore) vs. 30% (onshore PML)
- **Enhanced cost recovery**: Deep water PSCs typically allow 70-80% cost recovery ceiling vs. 50-60% for onshore operations

**Economic Rationale**: Offshore development requires significantly higher capital intensity (USD 3-5 billion for deepwater FPSO developments) and carries greater technical risk, environmental challenges, and operational complexity. The preferential fiscal terms compensate for these elevated costs and risks while maintaining government revenue through CIT and royalties.

### 3.2 Local Content Requirements (NOGICD Act 2010)

The **Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act 2010** mandates minimum Nigerian participation to build domestic capacity and ensure economic benefits accrue to Nigerian citizens and companies:

**Key Requirements:**
- **Nigerian first consideration**: Preference for Nigerian companies with equivalent capability in bidding and contract awards
- **Minimum local content targets**: Escalating percentages for equipment, services, and materials procurement
- **Personnel requirements**: Minimum percentages for Nigerian management and technical staff
- **Financial penalties**: 5% of project value for non-compliance
- **Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB)**: Enforcement agency requiring submission of Nigerian Content Plans with all project proposals

### 3.3 Transfer Pricing and Documentation

Nigerian transfer pricing rules (Income Tax (Transfer Pricing) Regulations 2018) require:
- **Arm's length pricing** for all related party transactions following OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
- **Master and Local File documentation** for companies with turnover exceeding NGN 1 billion
- **Country-by-Country Reporting** for multinationals with consolidated group revenue exceeding EUR 750 million

The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) established a dedicated Transfer Pricing Unit conducting audits of petroleum sector transactions, particularly service agreements and crude oil sales to affiliates.

## 4. Application Methodology: PSC Calculation Under PIA Framework

**Step 1:** Determine gross production volume and applicable royalty rate based on water depth and production level

**Step 2:** Calculate royalty payment (gross production × market price × royalty rate)

**Step 3:** Determine available production for cost recovery (gross production less royalty)

**Step 4:** Calculate cost recovery from available production (subject to PSC cost recovery ceiling, typically 70-80%)

**Step 5:** Calculate profit oil (available production less cost oil)

**Step 6:** Split profit oil per PSC contractual terms (typically 60-80% government share)

**Step 7:** Calculate Companies Income Tax (30%) on contractor's total taxable income

**Step 8:** For onshore/shallow water operations under PML, calculate Hydrocarbon Tax (30%) on contractor's profit

**Step 9:** Calculate Tertiary Education Tax (3%) on assessable profits

**Step 10:** Determine net contractor entitlement after all taxes and levies

## 5. Worked Example: Nigerian Deep Water PSC (PIA Framework)

### 5.1 Fact Pattern

**Offshore Oil Limited** operates Block 123 under a Deep Water PSC (water depth 250m) converted to PIA framework. For the 2024 fiscal year:

- **Gross production:** 25,000 barrels/day × 365 days = 9,125,000 barrels
- **Market price (Brent dated):** USD 85/barrel
- **Quality/location differential:** -USD 2/barrel = **USD 83/barrel realized**
- **Gross revenue:** 9,125,000 bbl × USD 83 = **USD 757,375,000**
- **Unrecovered costs b/f:** USD 120,000,000
- **Current year opex:** USD 80,000,000
- **Current year capex:** USD 150,000,000
- **Total costs available for recovery:** USD 350,000,000
- **PSC cost recovery ceiling:** 75%
- **PSC profit oil split:** Government 70% / Contractor 30%

### 5.2 Calculations

**Step 1: Royalty Calculation**
```
Water depth >200m, production = 25,000 bpd (<50,000 bpd threshold)
Base royalty rate = 5%
Oil price = $85/bbl (triggers price-based adjustment: above $60 to $100 = +4%)
Total royalty rate = 5% + 4% = 9%

Royalty = 9,125,000 bbl × USD 83 × 9% = USD 68,164,375
```

**Step 2: Available Production for Cost Recovery**
```
Gross revenue - Royalty = USD 757,375,000 - USD 68,164,375 = USD 689,210,625
```

**Step 3: Cost Oil (Cost Recovery)**
```
Maximum allowed = 75% × USD 689,210,625 = USD 516,907,969
Costs available = USD 350,000,000
Actual cost recovery = USD 350,000,000 (limited by available costs)
Unrecovered costs c/f: USD 0
```

**Step 4: Profit Oil**
```
USD 689,210,625 - USD 350,000,000 = USD 339,210,625
```

**Step 5: Profit Oil Split**
```
Government share (70%): USD 237,447,438
Contractor share (30%): USD 101,763,188
```

**Step 6: Companies Income Tax (Deep Offshore)**
```
Taxable income = Contractor's profit oil share = USD 101,763,188
CIT (30%) = USD 101,763,188 × 30% = USD 30,528,956
```

**Step 7: Hydrocarbon Tax**
```
Deep offshore operations are EXEMPT from Hydrocarbon Tax = USD 0
```

**Step 8: Tertiary Education Tax**
```
TET (3%) = USD 101,763,188 × 3% = USD 3,052,896
```

**Step 9: Contractor Net Entitlement**
```
Cost oil recovered: USD 350,000,000
Profit oil share: USD 101,763,188
Less CIT: (USD 30,528,956)
Less TET: (USD 3,052,896)
Net contractor take: USD 418,181,336 (55.2% of gross revenue)
```

**Step 10: Government Take Analysis**
```
Royalty: USD 68,164,375
Profit oil share: USD 237,447,438
CIT: USD 30,528,956
TET: USD 3,052,896
Total government take: USD 339,193,664 (44.8% of gross revenue)
```

**Summary Table:**

| Item | Amount (USD million) | Percentage of Gross Revenue |
|------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Gross Revenue | 757.4 | 100.0% |
| Royalty (9%) | (68.2) | (9.0%) |
| Cost Recovery (Contractor) | (350.0) | (46.2%) |
| Government Profit Oil | (237.4) | (31.3%) |
| Contractor Profit Oil | (101.8) | (13.4%) |
| Companies Income Tax (30%) | (30.5) | (4.0%) |
| Tertiary Education Tax (3%) | (3.1) | (0.4%) |
| **Net Contractor Take** | **418.2** | **55.2%** |
| **Total Government Take** | **339.2** | **44.8%** |

### 5.3 Key Observations

1. **Deep offshore fiscal advantages** under PIA: Exemption from Hydrocarbon Tax (0% vs. 30% for onshore PML) significantly improves contractor economics
2. **Price-based royalty adjustments**: At USD 85/bbl oil price, the +4% adjustment increases total royalty from 5% to 9%, capturing additional government revenue during higher price periods
3. **Cost recovery mechanism**: 75% ceiling with full recovery of USD 350 million in costs provides strong cash flow support for capital-intensive offshore development
4. **Dual taxation structure**: CIT (30%) plus TET (3%) creates 33% effective tax rate on contractor's profit oil share under PIA framework
5. **Government take competitiveness**: 44.8% total government take is competitive with international deepwater basins (Angola 50-60%, Ghana 55-65%), reflecting PIA 2021 reforms designed to attract offshore investment
6. **Profit oil split dynamics**: 70/30 government/contractor split provides government with substantial direct participation in production economics beyond taxation

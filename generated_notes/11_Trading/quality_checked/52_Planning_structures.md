# 52. Planning Structures

## 1. Introduction

**Planning structures** for oil and gas trading involves designing organizational and legal frameworks that optimize **tax efficiency**, **risk management**, **operational flexibility**, and **regulatory compliance**. The structure determines how trading activities interface with **upstream production**, **midstream logistics**, **downstream refining**, and **group treasury functions**.

Unlike purely operational considerations, planning structures require careful analysis of **transfer pricing**, **permanent establishment (PE) risks**, **withholding tax exposure**, **treaty access**, and **economic substance requirements**. Different structures suit different business models: **integrated majors** (e.g., Shell, ExxonMobil) typically adopt **centralized trading hubs**, while **independent exploration and production (E&P) companies** may use **decentralized marketing affiliates** or **agency structures**.

Oil and gas companies must select trading structures that balance four key objectives: (1) **tax efficiency** through profit allocation to low-tax jurisdictions, (2) **transfer pricing defensibility** using published commodity benchmarks, (3) **PE risk mitigation** to avoid unintended tax presence in producing/consuming countries, and (4) **economic substance compliance** to withstand increased scrutiny from tax authorities under OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) standards.

## 2. Trading Structure Models

### 2.1 Model 1: Centralized Principal Trading Company

**Structure:**

```
                    Parent Company (UK)
                           |
                           |
                 Trading Company (Switzerland/Singapore)
                    /      |      \
                   /       |       \
    Production    Production    Production
    Subsidiary    Subsidiary    Subsidiary
    (Norway)      (Indonesia)   (Brazil)
```

**Characteristics:**

1. **Single trading entity** purchases all group production at arm's length prices
2. **Legal title** to commodities passes to trading company
3. Trading company sells to **external customers** (refineries, utilities, traders)
4. **Profit center**: Trading company earns margin reflecting functions, assets, and risks

**Functions performed by trading company:**
- **Trade execution**: Negotiating purchase and sale contracts
- **Pricing**: Applying benchmark prices (Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI)) with adjustments
- **Risk management**: Hedging price exposure through derivatives
- **Logistics**: Arranging shipping, storage, insurance
- **Credit risk management**: Assessing counterparty creditworthiness

**Tax considerations:**

| **Aspect** | **Analysis** |
|---|---|
| **Transfer pricing** | Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method using published benchmarks; producing subsidiaries sell at arm's length prices |
| **Trading company margin** | 1-3% of traded value; must be defensible as arm's length |
| **Withholding tax (WHT)** | Payments from producing subsidiaries to trading company may trigger WHT (0-15% depending on treaty) |
| **Economic substance** | Trading company must have adequate personnel (8-15 employees), physical presence, and local decision-making |
| **PE risk** | If trading company personnel visit producing countries, risk of creating PE (typically mitigated by "preparatory or auxiliary" exception under Article 5(4) of tax treaties) |

**Advantages:**
- **Maximum tax efficiency**: Profits centralized in low-tax jurisdiction (Switzerland 11-15%, Singapore 5-15%)
- **Economies of scale**: Single entity manages all trading, risk, and logistics
- **Portfolio optimization**: Cross-commodity and geographic arbitrage opportunities

**Disadvantages:**
- **High compliance burden**: Detailed transfer pricing documentation for all intercompany transactions
- **Substance requirements**: Significant headcount and infrastructure needed
- **Regulatory scrutiny**: Tax authorities increasingly challenge centralized structures lacking genuine commercial rationale

### 2.2 Model 2: Decentralized Marketing Affiliates

**Structure:**

```
           Parent Company (UK)
                  |
        +---------+---------+
        |         |         |
    Marketing  Marketing  Marketing
    Affiliate  Affiliate  Affiliate
    (Norway)   (Indonesia) (Brazil)
        |         |         |
    Production Production Production
    Subsidiary Subsidiary Subsidiary
```

**Characteristics:**

1. Each **regional marketing affiliate** handles sales for local production
2. Marketing affiliate earns **commission or cost-plus margin** (not full trading margin)
3. **Legal title** may pass to marketing affiliate (principal) or remain with producing subsidiary (agent)

**Tax considerations:**

| **Aspect** | **Analysis** |
|---|---|
| **Transfer pricing** | Marketing affiliate earns limited margin (5-15% markup on costs or 0.5-1% commission on sales value) |
| **Local tax** | Profits taxed in producing country (higher rate: 40-78%) |
| **Withholding tax** | Reduced compared to centralized model (payments within same country or regional treaty benefits) |
| **Economic substance** | Lower substance requirements (2-5 employees per affiliate) |

**Advantages:**
- **Lower regulatory risk**: Each affiliate operates locally with clear nexus
- **Simpler transfer pricing**: Limited margin easier to defend than full trading margin
- **Customer proximity**: Marketing personnel close to end-users

**Disadvantages:**
- **Higher tax cost**: Profits taxed at producing country rates (40-78%) vs. trading hub rates (5-15%)
- **Duplicative costs**: Multiple affiliates require separate staffing, offices, systems
- **Limited portfolio optimization**: Each affiliate operates independently

---

### 2.3 Model 3: Principal-Agent (Commission Agent) Structure

**Structure:**

```
        Trading Company (Switzerland/Singapore)
               |  (Principal)
               |
        +------+------+
        |      |      |
    Agent   Agent   Agent
    (Norway) (Indon.) (Brazil)
        |      |      |
    Production Production Production
```

**Characteristics:**

1. **Trading company** (principal) retains legal and economic ownership of commodities
2. **Local agents** perform marketing activities on behalf of trading company
3. Agents earn **commission** (e.g., 5-10% of costs or 0.5-1% of sales value)
4. **Low risk** allocation to agents (limited functions and risks)

**Tax considerations:**

| **Aspect** | **Analysis** |
|---|---|
| **Transfer pricing** | Commission to agents must reflect limited functions (typically 5-10% markup on costs) |
| **PE risk** | **Key risk**: Agent may create PE for trading company if granted and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts (OECD Model Treaty Article 5(5), dependent agent PE) |
| **Withholding tax** | Commission payments from trading company to agents may trigger WHT (10-15%) |
| **Economic substance** | Trading company needs full substance (principal); agents need minimal substance (limited functions) |

**PE mitigation strategies:**
1. **Limit agent authority**: Agents may only solicit orders, not conclude contracts
2. **Contract approval**: All contracts must be approved by trading company personnel in Switzerland/Singapore
3. **Independent agent status**: Use legally independent entities (not employees seconded to agent)
4. **Preparatory or auxiliary exception**: Agents perform only supporting activities (market research, customer liaison)

**Advantages:**
- **Maximum profit to trading hub**: Trading company retains full margin (minus agent commission)
- **Lower local tax**: Limited profit taxed in producing countries (only agent commission)
- **Flexibility**: Trading company retains full control and decision-making

**Disadvantages:**
- **PE risk**: High risk if agent authority not carefully limited
- **Regulatory scrutiny**: Tax authorities increasingly challenge agent structures as lacking commercial substance

### 2.4 Model 4: Commissionnaire Structure

**Structure:**

```
        Trading Company (Switzerland/Singapore)
               |  (Principal)
               |
        +------+------+
        |      |      |
Commissionnaire Commissionnaire Commissionnaire
    (Norway)     (Indonesia)    (Brazil)
        |            |             |
    Sells in        Sells in      Sells in
    own name,       own name,     own name,
    on behalf       on behalf     on behalf
    of Trading Co.  of Trading Co. of Trading Co.
```

**Characteristics:**

1. **Commissionnaire** sells commodities **in its own name** but **on behalf of trading company** (principal)
2. **Customers deal with commissionnaire**, not trading company (trading company identity undisclosed)
3. **Legal title** never transfers to commissionnaire; remains with trading company
4. Commissionnaire earns **commission** for selling services

**Tax considerations:**

| **Aspect** | **Analysis** |
|---|---|
| **PE risk** | **Significant PE risk**: OECD BEPS Action 7 (Preventing Artificial Avoidance of PE Status) specifically targets commissionnaire arrangements |
| **OECD Model Treaty Article 5(5)** | Amended in 2017 to treat commissionnaires as creating PE for principal if habitually concluding contracts or playing principal role leading to conclusion of contracts routinely concluded without material modification |
| **MLI impact** | **Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI)** implementing BEPS Action 7 adopted by 100+ countries (entered into force July 1, 2018), expanding PE definition to capture commissionnaires |
| **Transfer pricing** | Commission to commissionnaire must reflect limited functions (5-10% markup on costs) |

The **MLI** enables rapid and consistent implementation of tax treaty recommendations from the BEPS project. Article 12 of the MLI specifically addresses "Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status through Commissionnaire Arrangements and Similar Strategies," modifying the application of existing tax treaty provisions to prevent PE avoidance through such structures.

**Post-BEPS landscape:**

**Before BEPS (pre-2017):**
- Commissionnaires did **not** create PE for principal (contracts concluded in commissionnaire's name)
- Widely used to avoid PE in producing/consuming countries

**After BEPS (2017+):**
- Commissionnaire creates **PE** for trading company if:
  - Habitually concludes contracts on behalf of principal, OR
  - Plays principal role leading to conclusion of contracts routinely concluded without material modification by principal
- **Result**: Trading company subject to tax in commissionnaire's country on profits attributable to PE

**Conclusion**: Commissionnaire structures are **largely obsolete** post-BEPS for tax planning purposes.

---

## 3. Tax Planning Considerations

### 3.1 Permanent Establishment (PE) Risk Management

**Key PE triggers in trading structures:**

1. **Dependent agent PE** (Article 5(5)):
   - Agent habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts on behalf of principal
   - **Mitigation**: Limit agent to order solicitation; contracts concluded by principal in hub jurisdiction

2. **Commissionnaire PE** (Article 5(5) post-BEPS):
   - Commissionnaire sells in own name but on behalf of principal
   - **Mitigation**: Avoid commissionnaire structures; use disclosed agency or principal structures

3. **Fixed place of business PE** (Article 5(1)):
   - Trading company maintains office or personnel in producing/consuming country
   - **Mitigation**: Ensure activities qualify as "preparatory or auxiliary" (Article 5(4))

**Best practice**: Conduct **PE risk assessment** before establishing local presence, considering:
- Nature of activities (core vs. preparatory/auxiliary)
- Agent authority and contract conclusion practices
- MLI impact (expanded PE definition adopted by 100+ countries)
- Local tax authority practice (aggressive vs. conservative PE interpretation)

### 3.2 Withholding Tax Optimization

**Payments potentially subject to WHT:**

| **Payment Type** | **Typical WHT Rate** | **Treaty Relief** | **Optimization Strategies** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dividends** (from producing subsidiary to trading company) | 10-30% | 0-15% (depending on ownership %) | • Use EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive (Council Directive 2011/96/EU): 0% WHT between EU members holding ≥10% for ≥1 year <br>• Hold >10-25% ownership to qualify for reduced treaty rate |
| **Interest** (on financing provided by trading company) | 10-30% | 0-15% | • Use interest-free loans (no WHT) <br>• Route through favorable treaty jurisdictions |
| **Royalties** (for intellectual property/technology provided by trading company) | 10-30% | 0-15% | • Recharacterize as business profits (not royalties) <br>• Use cost recharge structures |
| **Service fees** (for management/technical services) | 10-20% (in some countries) | 0-10% | • Evidence technical knowledge transfer to avoid WHT <br>• Use treaty relief for business profits (no PE) |

**Hybrid financing**: Some structures use **hybrid debt/equity** instruments to achieve deductibility (interest expense) without WHT (treated as equity in paying country).

### 3.3 Transfer Pricing Compliance

**Documentation requirements (OECD BEPS Actions 8-10 on transfer pricing, Action 13 on documentation):**

1. **Master File**:
   - Group organizational structure
   - Description of business (production, trading, refining)
   - Intangibles ownership and exploitation
   - Intercompany financing arrangements
   - Financial and tax positions by jurisdiction

2. **Local File** (for each trading entity):
   - Detailed functional analysis (functions, assets, risks)
   - Comparables (independent traders, CUP benchmarks, cost-plus comparables)
   - Transfer pricing method selection and application
   - Financial data and calculations

3. **Country-by-Country Report (CbCR)** (for groups >€750M revenue):
   - Revenue, profit, tax paid, employees, assets by jurisdiction
   - Highlights profit allocation to low-tax trading hubs
   - Triggers tax authority inquiries if misalignment between profits and substance

**Best practice**: Prepare **contemporaneous documentation** (i.e., documentation prepared before or when transactions occur, not after audit notice) to mitigate penalties (typically 10-50% of additional tax).

---

## 4. Integration with Group Functions

### 4.1 Coordination with Treasury

Trading companies often integrate with **group treasury functions**:

**Centralized treasury model**:
- Treasury company (often co-located with trading company) provides **financing**, **cash pooling**, and **hedging** for group
- Trading company accesses **trade finance** (letters of credit, pre-export financing) via treasury
- **Currency hedging**: Treasury manages foreign exchange (FX) risk arising from USD-denominated commodity sales and non-USD functional currencies

**Transfer pricing**: Treasury charges **interest** on loans (typically Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) + 1-3% margin, formerly London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) prior to its discontinuation in 2021) and **commission** on hedging services (5-15% markup on costs).

### 4.2 Coordination with Logistics

**Integrated supply chain**:
- Trading company coordinates **shipping**, **storage**, **blending**, and **transportation**
- May own or charter vessels (**shipping subsidiary**)
- Operates **storage terminals** for crude oil, refined products, liquefied natural gas (LNG)

**Tax considerations**:
- **Shipping income**: Often exempt or taxed at reduced rates (e.g., tonnage tax regimes in UK, Netherlands, Norway)
- **Storage facilities**: Create PE risk in storage location (mitigated if third-party operator)

## 5. Worked Example

═══════════════════════════════════════════
**WORKED EXAMPLE: Choosing Between Centralized Trading Company and Decentralized Marketing Affiliates**
═══════════════════════════════════════════

**Facts:**

GlobalPetro Inc., a U.S.-listed oil and gas company, produces **120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d)** from three regions:
- **Nigeria**: 50,000 boe/d
- **Kazakhstan**: 40,000 boe/d
- **Gulf of Mexico (U.S.)**: 30,000 boe/d

Production is sold directly by each producing subsidiary to third-party traders at **2% discount to benchmark prices**. The Board is evaluating two restructuring options:

**Option A: Centralized Trading Company (Singapore Global Trader Programme (GTP))**
- Establish **single trading company** in Singapore (5% tax rate under GTP Tier 1)
- Trading company purchases all production at arm's length prices (benchmark ± adjustments)
- Trading company sells to refineries and traders
- Operating costs: SGD 10 million annually (15 employees)
- Capture **full 2% trading margin** = $35 million (based on $80/bbl average)

**Option B: Decentralized Marketing Affiliates**
- Establish **three regional marketing affiliates** (Nigeria, Kazakhstan, U.S.)
- Each affiliate earns **0.75% commission** on sales (limited functions)
- Operating costs: $2 million per affiliate × 3 = $6 million total
- Capture **partial trading margin** = 0.75% × $1.75 billion = $13.1 million

**Producing country tax rates:**
- **Nigeria**: 30% corporate income tax (CIT) + 15-30% Hydrocarbon Tax under Petroleum Industry Act 2021 = **45-60%** (assuming 30% HT for onshore operations under Petroleum Mining Lease)
- **Kazakhstan**: 20% CIT + variable Excess Profits Tax (EPT) 10-60% = **approximately 40%** (combined effective rate, varies with profitability)
- **U.S. (Gulf of Mexico)**: 21% federal CIT + state and local taxes = **approximately 25-30%**

**Assumptions:**
- Annual production value: **$1.75 billion** (120,000 boe/d × 365 days × $80/bbl average)
- Current foregone margin: **$35 million** (2% of $1.75B)
- GlobalPetro consolidated revenue: **$6 billion** (exceeds €750M, subject to OECD Pillar Two)
- OECD Pillar Two top-up tax applies: 15% minimum rate
- Weighted average producing country tax rate for Option B: **45%** (weighted by production volumes)

**Required:**

Compare the two options, calculating:
1. Total after-tax profit captured under each structure
2. Tax cost in each jurisdiction
3. Economic substance and compliance considerations
4. Recommendation

**Analysis:**

**OPTION A: Centralized Trading Company (Singapore)**

**Step 1: Calculate Trading Company Profit**

```
Trading margin captured:                        $35 million
Less: Operating expenses:                       SGD 10M ÷ 1.35 = $7.41 million
Earnings Before Tax:                            $27.59 million
```

**Step 2: Calculate Tax**

Without OECD Pillar Two:
```
Singapore tax (5% GTP):                         $27.59M × 5% = $1.38 million
After-tax profit:                               $26.21 million
```

With OECD Pillar Two (15% minimum):
```
Singapore tax (5%):                             $1.38 million
Top-up tax (10%):                               $27.59M × 10% = $2.76 million
Total tax:                                      $4.14 million
After-tax profit:                               $27.59M - $4.14M = $23.45 million
```

**Effective tax rate**: 15.0%

**Step 3: Transfer Pricing and Compliance**

- **CUP method**: Producing subsidiaries sell at Brent/WTI ± adjustments
- **Documentation**: Master File, Local Files (4 entities), CbCR
- **Economic substance**: 15 employees (adequate for $1.75B trading volume)
- **Compliance cost**: SGD 2M annually (transfer pricing documentation, audits, GTP renewal)

**Total annual cost**: $7.41M (operating) + $1.48M (compliance) = **$8.89 million**

**OPTION B: Decentralized Marketing Affiliates**

**Step 1: Calculate Marketing Affiliate Profits**

Each affiliate earns **0.75% commission** on regional production:

| **Region** | **Production Value** | **Commission (0.75%)** | **Operating Costs** | **Profit Before Tax** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Nigeria** | $730M (50k boe/d) | $5.48M | $2.0M | $3.48M |
| **Kazakhstan** | $584M (40k boe/d) | $4.38M | $2.0M | $2.38M |
| **U.S. Gulf of Mexico** | $438M (30k boe/d) | $3.28M | $2.0M | $1.28M |
| **Total** | $1,752M | $13.14M | $6.0M | $7.14M |

**Step 2: Calculate Tax**

Each affiliate is taxed at local producing country rates:

| **Region** | **Profit Before Tax** | **Tax Rate** | **Tax** | **After-Tax Profit** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Nigeria** | $3.48M | 60% (CIT 30% + HT 30%) | $2.09M | $1.39M |
| **Kazakhstan** | $2.38M | 40% (CIT + EPT) | $0.95M | $1.43M |
| **U.S. Gulf of Mexico** | $1.28M | 27% (federal + state) | $0.35M | $0.93M |
| **Total** | $7.14M | — | $3.39M | $3.75M |

**Effective tax rate**: 3.39 / 7.14 = **47.5%**

**Step 3: Compliance**

- **Transfer pricing**: Limited (commission structure simpler to defend)
- **Documentation**: Master File, Local Files (3 affiliates)
- **Economic substance**: Lower requirements (2-5 employees per affiliate)
- **Compliance cost**: $0.5M annually per affiliate × 3 = **$1.5M**

**COMPARISON**

| **Metric** | **Option A: Centralized (Singapore)** | **Option B: Decentralized** |
|---|---|---|
| **Margin captured** | $35M (full 2%) | $13.14M (0.75% commission) |
| **Operating costs** | $8.89M | $7.5M ($6M + $1.5M compliance) |
| **Profit Before Tax** | $27.59M | $7.14M |
| **Tax** | $4.14M (15% with Pillar Two) | $3.39M (47.5% weighted average) |
| **After-tax profit** | **$23.45M** | **$3.75M** |
| **Benefit vs. current** | $23.45M (vs. $0 foregone margin) | $3.75M (vs. $0) |
| **Economic substance** | High (15 employees, significant infrastructure) | Low (2-5 employees per affiliate) |
| **Regulatory risk** | Moderate (transfer pricing scrutiny, GTP compliance) | Low (limited margin, local nexus) |

**Incremental Benefit of Option A over Option B**: $23.45M - $3.75M = **$19.70 million annually**

**Conclusion:**

**Recommendation: Option A (Centralized Trading Company in Singapore)**

The centralized Singapore trading company generates **$19.70 million higher after-tax profit** annually compared to decentralized marketing affiliates, despite:
- Higher operating and compliance costs ($8.89M vs. $7.5M)
- Higher substance requirements (15 employees vs. 6-15 across three affiliates)
- Greater regulatory scrutiny (transfer pricing, GTP compliance)

**Key success factors:**

1. **Economic substance**: 15 qualified employees in Singapore (traders, risk managers, logistics coordinators, compliance officers)
2. **Transfer pricing defense**: CUP method using published benchmarks (Brent, WTI); documented adjustments for quality and location
3. **GTP compliance**: Substantial use of Singapore services (banking, shipping, legal); third-party trading development (target 15-20% of volume)
4. **Regulatory engagement**: Advance ruling from Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) for GTP approval; annual transfer pricing documentation updates

**Risks and mitigations:**

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|---|---|
| **Transfer pricing challenge** | Obtain IRAS Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) for 5-year certainty; maintain contemporaneous documentation |
| **GTP revocation** | Ensure ongoing compliance with substance requirements; annual internal audit |
| **PE creation in producing countries** | Limit travel by Singapore personnel; ensure no contract conclusion authority in producing countries |
| **OECD Pillar Two complexity** | Engage tax advisor for Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) calculation and top-up tax compliance |

**Implementation timeline:**
- **Months 1-3**: Incorporate Singapore entity; apply for GTP; recruit key personnel
- **Months 4-6**: Establish infrastructure (office, systems); transfer pricing policy documentation
- **Months 7-9**: IRAS GTP approval; commence operations with pilot trades
- **Months 10-12**: Ramp up to full trading volume; transition from third-party traders

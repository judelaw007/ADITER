Slide: Worked Example 1: PE Determination for Seismic Vessel

Here's the thing with fact pattern.  SeismicCo Ltd., a Norwegian geophysical services company, conducts 3D seismic surveys off the coast of Indonesia under contract with IndonesiaPetro (Indonesian state oil company). SeismicCo operates a specialized seismic vessel for the project. June 1, 2024: Vessel arrives in Indonesian territorial waters June 1 - September 30, 2024: Seismic data acquisition (122 days) October 1-31, 2024: Data processing on vessel in Indonesian waters (31 days) November 1, 2024: Vessel departs Indonesian waters Total time in Indonesian waters: 153 days Contract fee: USD 15 million Indonesia-Norway Tax Treaty: Construction PE threshold: 120 days Service PE: Consultancy/technical services for aggregate >60 days in 12 months creates PE

Indonesia corporate tax rate: 22% Treaty business profits: Taxable only in Norway unless PE exists in Indonesia Question: Does SeismicCo have a PE in Indonesia? If yes, what profits are attributable? Now, analysis is interesting.  Article 5 General PE Test: Fixed place of business: Seismic vessel in Indonesian territorial waters Duration: 153 days continuously Through which business carried on: Survey operations Article 5(2) Specific Inclusions: Seismic vessel may constitute a "workshop" or "place of extraction" for natural resources (debatable - vessel not extracting but facilitating exploration). Article 5(3) Construction PE: Treaty threshold is 120 days. SeismicCo exceeded this threshold (153 days).

Article 5(4) Negative List: Seismic survey not "preparatory or auxiliary" - it is core business activity of SeismicCo and essential service for IndonesiaPetro's exploration. Actually, the activity constitutes the essential and significant part of seismicco's business operations, not merely supportive functions. Negative list does not apply. Service PE (UN-style): Many bilateral treaties include service PE provisions. Technical services for >60 days creates PE. SeismicCo provided services for 153 days, exceeding threshold. Conclusion: PE exists under construction PE rule (Article 5(3)) and likely under service PE if treaty includes such provision. Profit Attribution: Under Article 7 Authorized OECD Approach (AOA):

Total contract revenue: USD 15 million Direct costs (vessel operations, crew, fuel, equipment): USD 9 million (estimated 60% of revenue) Indirect costs (head office allocation): USD 1.5 million (10% of revenue) Attributable profit: USD 15M - USD 9M - USD 1.5M = USD 4.5 million Taxable profit: USD 4.5M Corporate tax (22%): USD 0.99 million Withholding tax on profit repatriation: Additional 20% on after-tax profit (some treaties) Planning Considerations: Contract structuring: Split contract into multiple mobilizations <120 days each (aggregate test may still apply) Flag jurisdiction: Consider vessel flag jurisdiction and whether creates different PE exposure Subcontracting: Engage independent Indonesian subcontractor (creates agent PE risk)

Advanced Ruling: Obtain Indonesian tax authority ruling on PE status before commencing operations Recommendation: PE exists. SeismicCo should: Register PE with Indonesian tax authorities File Indonesian corporate tax returns Maintain detailed accounts for profit attribution Prepare transfer pricing documentation for head office charges Consider advance pricing agreement (APA) for consistent treatment

Slide: Technical Rules and Application

Here's the thing with residence and treaty eligibility (article 4).  Resident Status: To access treaty benefits, taxpayer must be "resident" of contracting state, meaning: Individual: Resident under domestic law by domicile, residence, place of management, or similar criterion Company: Resident by place of incorporation, place of management, or place of effective management Dual Residence: Tie-breaker rules apply when entity resident in both states: Individual: Permanent home → center of vital interests → habitual abode → nationality → Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) Company: Place of effective management (POEM) - where key management/commercial decisions made POEM Determination (critical for energy companies):

Location of board meetings Location where key commercial decisions made Location of day-to-day management Location of senior executive offices Permanent Establishment (Article 5).  Fundamental Principle: Business profits taxable in source state only if enterprise has permanent establishment in that state (Article 7(1)). Article 5(1) General Definition: Fixed place of business through which business wholly or partly carried on. Article 5(2) Specific Inclusions (deemed PE): Place of management Mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources [Critically important for energy sector] Article 5(3) Construction PE: Building site, construction, assembly, or installation project constitutes PE if duration exceeds specified threshold:

OECD Model: 12 months UN Model: 6 months Many bilateral treaties (especially with developing countries): 3-6 months Often shorter for supervisory activities related to construction Article 5(4) Negative List (activities not constituting PE): Storage, display, delivery facilities (preparatory/auxiliary) Purchasing goods/merchandise Information collection activities Preparatory or auxiliary activities Preparatory or Auxiliary Activities Defined: Under OECD BEPS Action 7 revisions, an activity is preparatory if carried on in contemplation of the essential and significant part of the enterprise's activity. An auxiliary activity supports, without being part of, the essential and significant part of the enterprise's activity. The anti-fragmentation rule (Article 5(4.1)) prevents splitting of complementary functions to avoid PE status.

Article 5(5) Dependent Agent PE: Agent habitually exercising authority to conclude contracts creates PE (unless independent agent acting in ordinary course). Article 5(6) Independent Agent: Independent agent acting in ordinary course of business does NOT create PE for principal. Service PE (UN Model Article 5(3)(b)): Furnishing of services (including consultancy) through employees/personnel for aggregate >183 days (some treaties: >90 days or >60 days) in 12-month period creates PE. OECD Model added similar provision in 2017 updates. So when we talk about business profits attribution (article 7),  Authorized OECD Approach (AOA): PE treated as functionally separate enterprise. Profits attributed based on:

Functions performed The Authorized OECD Approach requires functional analysis treating the PE as if it were a separate entity dealing at arm's length with the head office. Transfer Pricing Principles: Arm's length principle applies to dealings between PE and head office. Requires functional analysis and comparability analysis. Common Energy Sector Issues: Allocation of exploration/development costs Attribution of production income Overhead allocation from head office Interest deductibility on attributed capital Commissionaire vs. buy-sell arrangements Now, withholding tax treaty reductions is interesting.  Dividends (Article 10): Interest (Article 11): Royalties (Article 12): Now, capital gains (article 13) is interesting. 

Source Taxation Permitted For: Article 13(1): Gains on immovable property (including petroleum/gas rights) - taxable in situs state Article 13(2): Gains on movable property of PE - taxable in PE state Article 13(4): Gains on shares deriving >50% value from immovable property - taxable in situs state (many treaties) Article 13(5): Other gains - taxable only in residence state Energy Sector Application: Sale of production assets: Article 13(1) - source taxation Sale of shares in operating company: Article 13(4) if immovable property company test met Indirect transfers: Many energy-producing countries have specific anti-avoidance rules taxing indirect transfers regardless of treaty

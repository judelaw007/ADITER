Slide: Worked Example: Income Flow Analysis Without Treaty Relief

Here's the thing with fact pattern.  EnergyTech Global Inc. (ETG), a US corporation, licenses proprietary drilling technology to its Nigerian subsidiary EnergyTech Nigeria Ltd. (ETN) for annual fee of USD 10 million. ETG also provides ongoing technical support services for annual fee of USD 5 million. ETN pays annual dividends of USD 20 million to ETG. Nigeria corporate tax: 30% Nigeria domestic withholding: Dividends 10%, interest 10%, royalties 10% US corporate tax: 21% Important: The United States and Nigeria do not have a tax treaty. So domestic withholding rates apply without treaty relief. ETN's Nigerian taxable income before US payments: USD 50 million What are the Nigerian withholding tax obligations?

What is ETG's US tax liability? How does the absence of treaty relief affect total tax cost? Now, analysis is interesting.  Nigerian Withholding Tax (No Treaty Relief): Dividends: USD 20M × 10% = USD 2.00M Royalties: USD 10M × 10% = USD 1.00M Technical fees: USD 5M × 10% = USD 0.50M Total Nigerian WHT: USD 3.50M ETN Nigerian Corporate Tax: Taxable income: USD 50M - USD 10M (royalty) - USD 5M (fees) = USD 35M Nigerian corporate tax: USD 35M × 30% = USD 10.50M After-tax profit: USD 35M - USD 10.50M = USD 24.50M Dividend paid: USD 20M (from current and prior year profits) ETG US Tax Position: Royalties: USD 10M Service fees: USD 5M Dividends: USD 20M US Section 245A Participation Exemption: Under Internal Revenue Code Section 245A (enacted December 2017), US domestic corporations that are United States shareholders may deduct 100% of the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations. Requirements include:

Minimum 10% ownership by vote or value Holding period of at least 365 days during the 731-day period beginning 365 days before the ex-dividend date Foreign corporation must not be a passive foreign investment company Since ETG is a 100% US corporate shareholder of ETN, the USD 20M dividend qualifies for 100% deduction under Section 245A. US Tax Calculation: US taxable income: USD 10M (royalties) + USD 5M (fees) + USD 0 (dividend excluded) = USD 15M US tax before credits: USD 15M × 21% = USD 3.15M Foreign tax credits available: - Nigerian WHT on royalties: USD 1.00M - Nigerian WHT on service fees: USD 0.50M - Total: USD 1.50M (dividend WHT not creditable due to Section 245A) Net US tax: USD 3.15M - USD 1.50M = USD 1.65M

Total Tax Cost (No Treaty Structure): Nigerian WHT: USD 3.50M Nigerian corporate tax: USD 10.50M US net tax: USD 1.65M Total: USD 15.65M Impact of No Treaty Relief Without a US-Nigeria tax treaty, the tax cost is significantly higher than would occur in a treaty environment. In jurisdictions with US tax treaties, typical treaty rates would be: Dividends: 5-15% (vs. 10% Nigerian domestic rate) Royalties: 0-10% (vs. 10% Nigerian domestic rate) Technical fees: Often 0% or covered under Article 7 (vs. 10% Nigerian domestic rate) Key Observations: No Treaty Benefit: The absence of treaty relief means full domestic withholding rates apply to all cross-border payments. Section 245A Value: The US participation exemption provides significant relief by excluding foreign dividends from US taxation, preventing double taxation at the corporate level even without treaty protection.

Foreign Tax Credit Limitation: ETG can credit Nigerian withholding taxes against US tax on the same income (royalties and fees), partially mitigating double taxation. But the foreign tax credit for dividend withholding is denied under Section 245A(d) since the dividend income itself is excluded from US taxation. Structural Considerations: In the absence of treaty relief, multinational groups may consider: - Routing payments through treaty jurisdictions (subject to anti-abuse rules) - Maximizing deductible payments (subject to transfer pricing and substance requirements) - Evaluating holding company structures in jurisdictions with favorable treaty networks Transfer Pricing Compliance: Regardless of treaty status, all related-party payments must satisfy arm's length pricing standards. ETG must maintain robust transfer pricing documentation demonstrating:

- Royalty payments reflect fair value of licensed IP - Service fees represent actual services provided at market rates - Proper functional analysis supports the characterization and pricing of transactions Alternative Characterization Analysis If ETG were to restructure payments (with proper substance): Reduce royalty to USD 5M (core IP license component) Increase service fees to USD 10M (expanded documented technical services) Maintain USD 20M dividend Revised Nigerian Withholding: Dividends: USD 20M × 10% = USD 2.00M Royalties: USD 5M × 10% = USD 0.50M Technical fees: USD 10M × 10% = USD 1.00M Total: USD 3.50M (unchanged - same domestic rate applies) Revised ETN Nigerian Corporate Tax: Taxable income: USD 50M - USD 5M - USD 10M = USD 35M (unchanged)

Nigerian tax: USD 10.50M (unchanged) Revised ETG US Tax: US taxable income: USD 5M + USD 10M = USD 15M (unchanged) US tax before credits: USD 3.15M Foreign tax credit: USD 0.50M + USD 1.00M = USD 1.50M Net US tax: USD 1.65M (unchanged) Total Tax Cost (Alternative): USD 15.65M (unchanged) Observation: Because Nigeria applies the same 10% domestic withholding rate to royalties, technical fees, and dividends in the absence of treaty relief, mere recharacterization among these payment types does not reduce total tax cost. Both royalties and service fees are deductible against Nigerian corporate tax, creating the same taxable base. The key planning imperative is ensuring that the characterization reflects genuine commercial substance and satisfies transfer pricing requirements in both jurisdictions.

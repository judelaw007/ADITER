You are required to create a complete presentation suite for a subject containing multiple chapters from the attached study notes. Follow these instructions:
Architecture
Subject-level files (created first):

index.html - Subject welcome page (not chapter-specific). Features subject title, description, and overview of all chapters
curriculum.html - Lists all chapters within the subject. Create one card per chapter with chapter title, description, and chapter overview

Per-chapter files (created sequentially for each chapter):

{chapter-number}-topic.html - Chapter introduction with chapter title, learning objectives, and key concepts
{chapter-number}-{section-number}-content.html - One file per main section within the chapter (NOT per chapter)
{chapter-number}-assessment.html - Chapter-level assessment
{chapter-number}-completion.html - Chapter-level completion page

Critical Content Rules (from original prompt)
For EACH chapter:

Count only the main section numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) within that chapter - this determines how many content files you create
Create EXACTLY ONE content file per main numbered section
Each content file must integrate ALL subsections (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) into single-level bullet points
Subsections do NOT get separate files - they are combined into their main section's bullets
Use the main section's topic as the file/section title (NO numbers displayed)
Generate 4-6 clear, single-level bullets per section (each bullet = one complete idea)

Per-Chapter File Generation
For each chapter:

Topic page: Chapter title, chapter overview, learning objectives
Content pages: Create N files (where N = number of main sections). Each file title = main section topic, containing integrated 4-6 bullets covering all subsection material
Assessment: Chapter-level MCQ with N questions (one per main section)
Completion: Chapter-level completion with chapter-specific achievements

Content Rules (Non-negotiable)

Use ONLY material from study notes - no additions
Include only existing examples and case studies
Do NOT suggest diagrams, charts, or visuals
Preserve all key terminology exactly
Single-level bullets only
Distill to scannable points

File Naming Convention
{chapter-number}-{chapter-slug}-topic.html
{chapter-number}-{chapter-slug}-{section-number}-content.html
{chapter-number}-{chapter-slug}-assessment.html
{chapter-number}-{chapter-slug}-completion.html
Example for "Arm's Length Principles" chapter with 4 main sections:
01-arms-length-topic.html
01-arms-length-1-content.html
01-arms-length-2-content.html
01-arms-length-3-content.html
01-arms-length-4-content.html
01-arms-length-assessment.html
01-arms-length-completion.html
Navigation

Index links to curriculum
Curriculum links to each chapter's topic page
Topic page links to first content page
Content pages link sequentially (content 1 → content 2 → etc.)
Last content page links to assessment
Assessment links to completion
Completion links back to curriculum or next chapter

Deliverables

index.html (subject welcome)
curriculum.html (all chapters listed)
Multiple chapter folders, each containing topic, N content files, assessment, and completion files
README.md (subject-level documentation)

Process each chapter completely (all its files) before moving to the next chapter.

Slide: Worked Example 1: Crude Oil Sales Transfer Pricing

Here's the thing with fact pattern.  GlobalOil Inc. (US parent) owns NigeriaOil Ltd. (Nigerian subsidiary). NigeriaOil produces crude oil in Nigeria (500,000 barrels per month) and sells to GlobalOil's trading subsidiary OilTrade SA (Singapore). OilTrade resells crude to independent refineries globally. Transaction Pricing: NigeriaOil → OilTrade: USD 75/barrel OilTrade → Independent refineries: USD 80/barrel (average) Dated Brent: USD 78/barrel (benchmark for Nigerian crude) Quality differential: Nigerian crude trades at Dated Brent minus USD 2/barrel (lower quality) Location differential: Nigerian FOB vs. Brent delivered Northwest Europe: minus USD 1/barrel Arm's length price: USD 78 - USD 2 - USD 1 = USD 75/barrel

Question: Is the USD 75/barrel transfer price between NigeriaOil and OilTrade arm's length? Now, analysis is interesting.  Method Selection: Quoted Price Method (QPM) most appropriate for crude oil sales. Publicly available commodity pricing provides reliable benchmark. Benchmark Determination: Reference price: Dated Brent (appropriate benchmark for West African crude) Quality adjustment: Nigerian crude typically trades at discount to Brent due to higher sulfur, lower API gravity. Market data indicates USD 2/barrel discount. Location adjustment: Nigerian FOB vs. Brent delivered Northwest Europe. Transportation differential: USD 1/barrel. Timing adjustment: If pricing lags (e.g., month average), adjust for price movements.

Adjusted Benchmark: USD 78 (Brent) - USD 2 (quality) - USD 1 (location) = USD 75/barrel Transfer Price Comparison: Related party price: USD 75/barrel Arm's length price: USD 75/barrel Conclusion: Transfer price of USD 75/barrel is arm's length. Pricing reflects appropriate adjustments to public benchmark. OilTrade Margin Analysis: Purchase price: USD 75/barrel Resale price: USD 80/barrel Gross margin: USD 5/barrel (6.7% on sales) Functional Analysis: OilTrade performs marketing, logistics coordination, credit risk management Limited functions (does not take title to inventory, limited market risk) Comparable trading companies earn gross margins: 4-8% on commodity trading Conclusion: OilTrade's 6.7% margin is within arm's length range for limited-function trading activities.

Documentation Requirements: QPM analysis with Dated Brent and adjustment factors TNMM benchmarking study for OilTrade Functional analysis of NigeriaOil and OilTrade Contemporaneous documentation of pricing policy Recommendation: Pricing structure is defensible. Maintain: Monthly tracking of benchmark vs. actual pricing Documentation of quality and location differentials Analysis of OilTrade's margin vs. comparables Consideration of APA to provide certainty in Nigeria

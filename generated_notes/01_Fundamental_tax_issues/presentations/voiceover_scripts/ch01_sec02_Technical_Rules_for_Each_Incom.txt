Slide: Technical Rules for Each Income Stream

Here's the thing with withholding tax rate summary.  Note on Model Convention Rates: The OECD Model Tax Convention (2017) specifies maximum withholding rates in its standard provisions, but many bilateral treaties negotiate lower rates. The United Nations (UN) Model Convention does not prescribe fixed withholding rates, leaving these to be determined through bilateral negotiations between treaty partners, typically reflecting developing countries' preference for retaining source-based taxation rights. Here's the thing with dividend income.  Domestic Treatment: Source jurisdiction taxes distributed profits at corporate level, then applies withholding tax on dividend payment. Treaty Relief: Treaties reduce withholding based on shareholding percentage:

Direct investment (typically >10%): 0-5% WHT Portfolio investment: 10-15% WHT Parent-subsidiary directive (EU): 0% WHT if >10% holding for >1 year Beneficial Ownership: Treaties deny reduced rates unless recipient is beneficial owner with economic substance. Mere conduit companies are disregarded [OECD Commentary to Article 10]. Participation Exemption: Many residence jurisdictions exempt foreign dividends from taxation if: Minimum holding: >5-10% Minimum holding period: 12-24 months Subsidiary subject to comparable taxation The policy rationale for participation exemption is to eliminate double taxation of corporate profits and facilitate cross-border investment by ensuring that foreign-source dividends are not taxed again when repatriated to the parent company, provided certain substance requirements are met.

Now, interest income is interesting.  Source vs. Residence Taxation: Under OECD Model Article 11, interest is primarily taxable in the beneficiary's residence state, with limited source taxation permitted (maximum 10% under the Model). UN Model similarly permits source taxation at rates determined through bilateral negotiation (typically 10%). Anti-Avoidance Rules: Thin Capitalization: Limits interest deductibility when debt-to-equity ratio exceeds prescribed threshold (typically 3:1 or 4:1). Excess interest may be recharacterized as dividend subject to higher withholding. Earnings Stripping: Modern rules limit interest deductions to percentage of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) (typically 10-30%) regardless of debt-to-equity ratio. Implements OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 4 recommendations (2015-2016).

Associated Enterprise: Article 11(6) permits recharacterization of excessive interest as dividends when rate or amount exceeds arm's length parameters. So when we talk about royalty income,  Definition: Payments for use of intellectual property (patents, know-how, designs) or natural resource extraction rights. Extraction Royalties vs. IP Royalties: Many jurisdictions distinguish: Extraction royalties: Payments to government or landowner for right to extract resources (typically not reduced by treaty) IP royalties: Payments for use of technology or knowledge (treaty relief available) Technical Service Fees vs. Royalties: Critical distinction: Royalties: Payment for passive use of IP; payer not required to utilize services

Technical fees: Payment for active services; characterized under Article 7 (business profits) or special service articles OECD vs. UN Model: OECD Model (2017) recommends exclusive residence taxation (0% source withholding) on royalties; UN Model permits source taxation at rates negotiated bilaterally, typically around 10%, reflecting developing countries' preference for source-based taxation. Now, technical service fees is interesting.  Treaty Treatment: Most OECD-based treaties do not permit source withholding on fees for independent services (Article 7 – taxable only if PE exists). Many UN-based and bilateral treaties include Technical Services Article permitting 5-20% source withholding. Dependent vs. Independent Services: Historical distinction (pre-2000 OECD Model):

Independent services (Article 14): Professionals, consultants, technical advisers Dependent services: Employees (Article 15) Modern treaties eliminate Article 14, treating all services under Article 7 (business profits) unless PE exists. Make-Available Provision: Some treaties reduce/eliminate withholding if services "make available" technical knowledge enabling recipient to apply knowledge independently without ongoing involvement.

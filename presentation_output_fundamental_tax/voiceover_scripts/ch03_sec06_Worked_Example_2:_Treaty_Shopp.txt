Slide: Worked Example 2: Treaty Shopping and PPT Application

Here's the thing with fact pattern.  OilInvest Cayman Ltd. (OIC), a Cayman Islands company owned by a private equity fund (US investors), holds 100% shares in BrazilOil Ltda. (Brazilian oil and gas production company). BrazilOil pays annual dividends of USD 50 million. Brazil domestic withholding on dividends: 25% Cayman Islands: 0% corporate tax, no dividend withholding United States: 21% corporate tax; 30% dividend withholding Treaty Analysis: Brazil-Cayman: No tax treaty Brazil-Netherlands: Dividend withholding 10% (for >10% holdings) Brazil-Luxembourg: Dividend withholding 15% (for >10% holdings) Restructuring: OIC establishes Netherlands HoldCo BV (Dutch company) as intermediate holding company. Netherlands HoldCo owns BrazilOil shares; OIC owns Netherlands HoldCo shares.

Post-Restructuring: OilInvest Cayman Netherlands HoldCo BV (established 2024) BrazilOil Ltda (Brazil) Netherlands HoldCo substance: Office: Serviced office space (EUR 50K annually) Directors: Two Dutch directors (non-executive, attend 4 meetings annually) Employees: None (administrative services outsourced) Bank account: Dutch bank account Question: Will Brazil-Netherlands treaty benefits be available? How does PPT apply? Now, analysis is interesting.  Without Netherlands HoldCo (Current): Dividend: USD 50M Brazil withholding tax (no treaty): USD 50M × 25% = USD 12.5M Net to Cayman: USD 37.5M With Netherlands HoldCo (Proposed): Dividend: USD 50M Brazil withholding tax (treaty rate): USD 50M × 10% = USD 5.0M Netherlands tax: USD 0 (participation exemption, assuming qualified)

Netherlands withholding tax on dividend to Cayman: Typically 15% domestic rate (no treaty) Tax savings if retained in Netherlands: USD 7.5M annually Treaty Eligibility Tests: 1. Residence (Article 4): Netherlands HoldCo is Dutch tax resident (incorporated in Netherlands, place of effective management may be questioned). 2. Beneficial Ownership (Article 10 Commentary): Netherlands HoldCo must be beneficial owner of dividends: Legal right to receive: ✓ Right to use and enjoy: Questionable - immediately paid to Cayman Economic substance: Limited - serviced office, outsourced services Decision-making authority: Questionable - PE fund likely controls Risk: Tax authorities may deny beneficial ownership status if Netherlands HoldCo acts as mere conduit.

3. Principal Purpose Test (PPT) (if Brazil-Netherlands treaty modified by MLI): Was one of the principal purposes obtaining treaty benefits? Timing: Netherlands HoldCo established shortly before dividend Business purpose: No operational reason beyond tax Substance: Minimal employees, serviced office Alternative structures: Direct holding from Cayman would incur higher tax Conclusion: Likely YES - obtaining treaty benefit was one of principal purposes. Would granting benefit be contrary to treaty object/purpose? Treaty intended to prevent double taxation and facilitate genuine cross-border investment Structure appears designed primarily for treaty access (treaty shopping) Ultimate beneficial owners (US PE fund) could not directly access same treaty benefits

Conclusion: Likely YES - granting benefits contrary to object/purpose. PPT Application: Brazilian tax authorities likely to deny treaty benefits under Principal Purpose Test (PPT), applying 25% domestic withholding rate. Alternative Approach - Genuine Substance: If OIC restructures Netherlands HoldCo with genuine substance: Purpose: Regional European headquarters managing multiple Latin American investments (not just Brazil) Employees: 5-10 employees including Chief Financial Officer, investment managers, legal/compliance Functions: Active investment management, treasury, compliance, group financing Office: Physical office space with operational facilities Decision-making: Board meetings with documented decisions, investment committee

Timing: Established with clear business plan, pre-existing Brazilian investment PPT Analysis with Substance: Principal purpose: Regional management hub (tax benefit incidental, not principal) Business purpose: Clear non-tax rationale Contrary to object/purpose: Arguable no - genuine cross-border investment facilitation Conclusion: If genuine substance established, PPT less likely to apply. But beneficial ownership still requires economic substance and genuine decision-making authority. Short term: Do not implement Netherlands structure without substantial business purpose and operational substance. Risk of treaty benefit denial is high. Long term: If OIC developing multiple Latin American investments, consider:

Establish Netherlands regional hub with genuine operational substance Document clear business purposes and functions beyond tax Obtain advance tax ruling from Dutch and Brazilian authorities Consider Luxembourg or other jurisdictions with similar treaty networks and European Union law protections Ensure compliance with substance requirements, beneficial ownership tests, and PPT defenses Cost-benefit: Netherlands substance costs EUR 500K-1M annually; tax savings USD 7.5M annually. Viable if substance genuine and PPT risk mitigated.

Slide: Core Framework and Legal Basis

Transfer pricing governs the pricing of transactions between related parties across tax jurisdictions. In the energy resources sector, transfer pricing affects commodity sales, service arrangements, financing, intellectual property licensing, and cost-sharing agreements. Improper transfer pricing results in profit shifting, double taxation, penalties, and reputational damage. Here's the thing with statutory foundation.  Domestic Legislation: Most jurisdictions incorporate the arm's length principle in domestic law: United States (US): Internal Revenue Code Section 482 United Kingdom (UK): Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010, Part 4 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Members: Implementation of OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines

Developing Countries: Often based on United Nations (UN) Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing Treaty Basis: Article 9 of OECD Model Tax Convention provides treaty foundation: > "Where... conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly." OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (2022 edition): Authoritative international standard interpreting and applying the arm's length principle. Adopted by OECD and G20 countries. Over 50 jurisdictions explicitly reference the Guidelines in domestic legislation or administrative practice.

Here's the thing with the arm's length principle.  Definition: Transactions between related parties should be priced as if conducted between independent enterprises dealing at arm's length under comparable circumstances. Ensures proper allocation of taxable profits among jurisdictions Prevents artificial profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions Promotes parity between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and independent enterprises Facilitates efficient tax administration Comparable Uncontrolled Transaction: The benchmark for arm's length pricing is pricing between independent parties in comparable transactions under comparable circumstances. Comparability Factors (OECD Guidelines Chapter I): Characteristics of property/services: Quality, volume, timing, terms

Functional analysis: Functions performed, assets used, risks assumed Contractual terms: Pricing terms, delivery, warranties, risk allocation Economic circumstances: Geographic markets, size, competition, government regulation Business strategies: Innovation, market penetration, diversification Now, functional analysis is interesting.  Critical Foundation: Transfer pricing analysis begins with detailed functional analysis identifying: Functions: Activities performed by each party: Exploration and development Production and extraction Processing and refining Marketing and distribution Research and development Management and administration Assets: Tangible and intangible assets employed: Petroleum concessions and licenses

Production equipment and facilities Intellectual property (seismic data, technology, know-how) Human capital (specialized expertise) Risks: Commercial and financial risks assumed: Exploration risk (geological uncertainty) Development risk (cost overruns, delays) Production risk (reservoir performance, operational disruption) Price risk (commodity price volatility) Political and regulatory risk Environmental and safety risk Credit and currency risk Risk Allocation Principle: Party assuming economically significant risks is entitled to risk-adjusted returns. Risk allocation must be consistent with: Contractual terms Conduct of parties Financial capacity to assume risk Control over risk (OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Actions 8-10, finalized in 2015)

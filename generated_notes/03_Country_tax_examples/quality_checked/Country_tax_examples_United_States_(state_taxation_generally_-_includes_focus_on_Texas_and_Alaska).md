## 1. Core Framework of US State Petroleum Taxation

### 1.1 Federal vs. State Jurisdiction

The United States operates a **dual sovereignty system** where both federal and state governments possess independent taxing authority over petroleum extraction. This bifurcation creates complex compliance obligations for energy companies operating across multiple jurisdictions, requiring separate calculations, reporting, and payment systems for federal and state tax obligations.

**Constitutional Basis:**
- **Tenth Amendment** (US Constitution): Powers not delegated to the federal government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. This constitutional provision forms the foundation for state taxing authority over natural resources within state boundaries.
- **Commerce Clause** (US Constitution, Article I, Section 8): Grants Congress power to regulate interstate commerce; limits state taxation of interstate commerce through judicial interpretation requiring nexus, fair apportionment, non-discrimination, and fair relationship to state services (*Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady*, 430 U.S. 274 [1977])
- **State ownership**: States own minerals beneath state lands and state territorial waters (extending 0-3 nautical miles from coastline under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953)
- **Federal ownership**: Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) beyond state territorial waters, federal lands (Bureau of Land Management lands, national forests, etc.)

**Jurisdictional Division:**
- **Federal taxation**: Corporate income tax (21% under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017), federal royalties on OCS production and federal land production, depletion allowances, intangible drilling cost deductions
- **State taxation**: Severance taxes (production taxes), state corporate income taxes, property taxes (ad valorem taxes on petroleum reserves and equipment), franchise taxes or privilege taxes
- **No preemption**: States may tax petroleum operations within their jurisdiction independently of federal taxation. There is no constitutional prohibition against layered federal and state taxation of the same activity, though state taxes are generally deductible for federal tax purposes under IRC §164.

### 1.2 Constitutional Limitations on State Taxation

States' taxing authority, while broad, faces constitutional constraints established through judicial interpretation:

**1. Commerce Clause Limitations (Complete Auto Transit Test):**

The Supreme Court established in *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady*, 430 U.S. 274 (1977), that states may tax interstate commerce only if the tax satisfies a four-part test:
- **Substantial nexus** exists between the state and the taxpayer's activity being taxed
- Tax is **fairly apportioned** to activities conducted within the state (both external consistency and internal consistency)
- Tax does **not discriminate** against interstate commerce in favor of local commerce
- Tax is **fairly related to services** provided by the state to the taxpayer

Petroleum production operations create substantial physical nexus through wellheads, production facilities, pipelines, and surface equipment located within state boundaries. Post-*South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.*, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018), physical presence is not required for nexus; economic nexus standards (sales or transaction thresholds) may also establish nexus, though petroleum production typically involves substantial physical presence.

**2. Due Process Clause (Fourteenth Amendment):**

Requires **minimum contacts** between the taxpayer and the taxing jurisdiction sufficient to satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The Due Process threshold is lower than the Commerce Clause nexus requirement. For petroleum operations, production activities within a state easily satisfy Due Process minimum contacts.

**3. Supremacy Clause (Article VI):**

State taxes cannot conflict with federal law, federal treaties, or valid federal regulations. For petroleum operations, this limitation prevents states from taxing production on federal lands (states may not impose severance taxes on federal mineral production, though operators may owe state income tax on net income from federal operations).

### 1.3 Major Petroleum-Producing States

**Top 5 Crude Oil Producing States (Based on 2023-2024 Production Data):**

1. **Texas**: Approximately **43%** of US crude oil production (~5.5 million barrels per day); dominates Permian Basin production
2. **New Mexico**: Approximately **14%** of production; Permian Basin (Delaware Basin portion)
3. **North Dakota**: Approximately **10%** of production; Bakken formation and Three Forks play
4. **Alaska**: Approximately **4%** of production (declining from historic highs of >2 million bbl/day in 1988 to current ~450,000 bbl/day); North Slope production
5. **Oklahoma**: Approximately **4%** of production; STACK and SCOOP plays

Each state maintains distinct fiscal regimes reflecting political economy, resource endowment characteristics, revenue dependency, and competing policy objectives (revenue maximization versus investment attraction). States with high fiscal dependency on petroleum revenues (Alaska, North Dakota) tend to impose higher effective tax rates, while states with diversified economies (Texas) may adopt lower rates to encourage production and employment.

## 2. Technical Rules - State-Specific Taxation

### 2.1 Texas Petroleum Taxation

Texas imposes **no state corporate income tax**, relying instead on severance taxes, a franchise tax on business margin, and local property taxes. This tax structure reflects Texas's business-friendly policy orientation and constitutional constraints limiting income taxation.

#### 2.1.1 Severance Tax

**Statutory Basis:** Texas Tax Code, Title 2, Subtitle E (Chapters 201-202)

**Oil Production Tax (Texas Tax Code §201.052):**
- **Base rate**: **4.6%** of **market value** at the wellhead
- **Additional oil field cleanup fee**: **0.125%** of market value (Texas Tax Code §201.203)
- **Combined effective rate**: **4.725%**
- **Tax base**: Gross value at the point of production (before deduction for transportation, processing, or other post-production costs)
- **Valuation**: Market value determined by the first sale of oil in an arm's-length transaction, or by posted prices if no arm's-length sale occurs
- **Payment**: Monthly tax return and payment due by the **20th day** of the month following the month of production
- **Administrator**: Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts

**Natural Gas Production Tax (Texas Tax Code §201.052):**
- **Base rate**: **7.5%** of **market value** at the wellhead
- **Tax base**: Gross value at the point of production
- **Valuation**: Market value at the mouth of the well (wellhead); for gas sold at the wellhead, actual sales price; for gas transported off-lease, value determined by subtracting reasonable transportation costs from downstream sales price
- **High-cost gas exemption**: Reduced rates available for qualifying high-cost gas wells (wells with lifting costs exceeding specified thresholds); rates may be reduced to as low as **0%** for qualifying production
- **Payment**: Monthly tax return and payment due by the 20th day of the following month

**Tax Incentives and Exemptions:**
- **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) production**: Severance tax reduction for incremental production from certified EOR projects
- **Inactive well exemption**: Production from wells producing less than **10 barrels per day** (or gas equivalent) may qualify for temporary severance tax exemption
- **High-cost gas wells**: Wells with certificated lifting costs exceeding $1.50 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) qualify for reduced rates on a sliding scale
- **Low-producing wells**: Wells meeting specific production thresholds may qualify for reduced rates

**Calculation Methodology:**
```
Market Value at Wellhead = Production Volume × Market Price (posted price or actual sales price)

Oil Severance Tax = Market Value × 4.6%
Oil Field Cleanup Fee = Market Value × 0.125%
Total Oil Tax = Market Value × 4.725%

Gas Severance Tax = Market Value × 7.5% (subject to high-cost adjustments)
```

#### 2.1.2 Franchise Tax (Margin Tax)

**Statutory Basis:** Texas Tax Code, Chapter 171

**Structure:**

Texas imposes a franchise tax (commonly called the "margin tax") on entities doing business in Texas. Despite its name, it functions as a gross receipts tax on business margin rather than a traditional net income tax.

**Tax Rates:**
- **Standard rate**: **0.75%** of taxable margin (applicable to most businesses, including exploration and production companies)
- **Wholesale/retail rate**: **0.375%** of taxable margin (for entities primarily engaged in wholesale or retail trade)
- Petroleum E&P companies typically pay the **0.75%** standard rate unless engaged primarily in wholesale or retail petroleum product sales

**Revenue Threshold (No Tax Due):**
- Entities with **total revenue** of **$2.47 million** or less (2024 threshold, indexed for inflation) owe no franchise tax and are not required to file franchise tax reports (threshold increased from $1.18 million by Senate Bill 3, enacted 2023, effective for reports originally due on or after January 1, 2024)
- **Prior threshold**: $1.23 million (2024 reports for 2023 tax year)

**Taxable Margin Calculation:**

Taxable margin equals the **lowest** of four calculations:
1. Total revenue minus **cost of goods sold** (COGS)
2. Total revenue minus **compensation**
3. **70%** of total revenue
4. **30%** of total revenue (for certain partnerships and professional firms)

**Petroleum E&P Application:**

E&P companies typically calculate margin as **total revenue minus cost of goods sold**, where COGS includes:
- Lease operating expenses (LOE)
- Production costs
- Direct costs of producing, acquiring, and reselling oil and gas
- Depreciation (limited basis)

**Apportionment:**

Franchise tax is apportioned to Texas using a single-factor receipts formula:
```
Texas Apportionment Percentage = Texas Receipts ÷ Total Receipts Everywhere

Texas Taxable Margin = Total Margin × Texas Apportionment Percentage

Franchise Tax = Texas Taxable Margin × 0.75%
```

For petroleum production, receipts are generally sourced to the location of production (Texas if wells are in Texas).

#### 2.1.3 Property Tax (Ad Valorem Tax)

**Statutory Basis:** Texas Property Tax Code, Title 1

**Structure:**

Texas imposes **local property taxes** (not state-level) on real and personal property, including oil and gas reserves, production equipment, and surface facilities. Property taxes are assessed and collected by counties, school districts, cities, and special districts.

**Tax Base:**
- **Proven oil and gas reserves** (mineral interests)
- **Production equipment and facilities** (wellhead equipment, separators, tanks, pipelines, compressors)
- **Surface real property** (land, buildings)

**Valuation:**
- **Market value** as of **January 1** of each tax year
- **Reserves valuation**: Typically determined using **discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology** based on proved developed producing (PDP) reserves; reserve value equals present value of future net revenues from proved reserves
- **Equipment valuation**: Fair market value considering age, condition, and functional utility
- **Assessment**: Conducted by county appraisal districts; specialized petroleum reserve engineers perform reserve valuations

**Tax Rates:**
- **Vary by jurisdiction**: Combination of county, school district, city, and special district rates
- **Typical combined rate**: **2.0% to 2.5%** of assessed value (higher in some jurisdictions, lower in others)
- **Example**: County rate 0.5% + School district rate 1.3% + City rate 0.3% = 2.1% total

**Payment:**
- Tax bills issued in **October**
- Payment due by **January 31** of the following year
- Penalties and interest apply for late payment

**Property Tax Calculation:**
```
Assessed Value = Market Value × Assessment Ratio (typically 100% for mineral interests)

Property Tax = Assessed Value × Combined Tax Rate
```

### 2.2 Alaska Petroleum Taxation

Alaska employs a sophisticated **net-based production tax** combined with state corporate income tax and royalties on state lands, creating a substantially higher overall tax burden than Texas. Alaska's fiscal dependency on petroleum revenues (historically 80-90% of unrestricted state general fund revenue, declining to approximately 50-60% in recent years) drives higher effective rates.

#### 2.2.1 Production Tax

**Statutory Basis:** Alaska Statutes Title 43.55 (Oil and Gas Production Tax)

**Historical Context:**

Alaska's production tax has undergone multiple reforms:
- **Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT)**: Enacted 2006; 22.5% net tax with progressivity
- **Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share (ACES)**: Enacted 2007 under Governor Sarah Palin; **25% base rate** with **progressive surcharge** reaching effective rates up to 75% at high oil prices
- **Senate Bill 21 / More Alaska Production Act (MAPA)**: Enacted **2013**; replaced ACES with **35% flat rate** (eliminating progressivity); introduced per-barrel credits; upheld in veto referendum (August 2014) with 52.7% voter approval

**Current Structure (Post-SB 21, Effective 2013-Present):**

**Base Rate**: **35%** of **net production value** (gross value minus qualified capital expenditures and lease expenditures)

**Net Production Value Calculation:**
```
Gross Production Value = Production Volume × Alaska North Slope (ANS) West Coast Price

Less: Qualified Capital Expenditures (QCE) - capital costs incurred during tax year
Less: Lease Expenditures - operating costs, transportation to point of sale
Less: Adjustments for non-producing properties and allocation adjustments
________________________________________________________________________
= Production Tax Value (PTV) before credits

Production Tax (before credits) = PTV × 35%

Less: Per-Barrel Credits (if applicable)
________________________________________________________________________
= Net Production Tax Due
```

**Per-Barrel Credits:**

- **Small producer credit**: Up to **$8 per barrel** for producers with average daily production **below 50,000 barrels per day**
  - Credit amount varies with oil price: $8/bbl at prices <$80/bbl; $7/bbl at $80-90/bbl; $6/bbl at $90-100/bbl; $5/bbl at $100-110/bbl; continuing to phase down at higher prices
  - Producers between 50,000 and 100,000 bbl/day receive a reduced pro-rata credit
  - Credit is non-transferable and cannot reduce production tax below zero (non-refundable after elimination of refundable credits in 2016-2017)

- **New production credit**: Additional credits may apply for new production from new participating areas or new units

**Minimum Tax Floor:**

A minimum production tax floor of **4% of gross production value** applies when the calculated net tax (35% of net value minus credits) falls below this threshold, ensuring minimum state revenue even during low price environments or for high-cost operations.

**Qualified Capital Expenditures (QCE):**

Capital expenditures that qualify for immediate deduction against production tax include:
- Drilling and completion costs for development wells
- Production facilities construction
- Pipeline infrastructure
- Enhanced oil recovery equipment
- Workovers and recompletions

QCE provides immediate tax benefit (35% tax reduction) rather than capitalization and depreciation, incentivizing capital investment in Alaska operations.

#### 2.2.2 Corporate Income Tax

**Statutory Basis:** Alaska Statutes Title 43.20 (Alaska Net Income Tax Act)

**Structure:**

Alaska imposes a graduated state corporate income tax on corporations doing business in Alaska, including petroleum production companies.

**Tax Rates (Graduated Structure):**
- **0% to 9.4%** on taxable income
- **Top marginal rate**: **9.4%** on taxable income exceeding **$222,000** (2024 threshold)
- **Brackets**: Progressive rate structure with multiple brackets; most large petroleum companies pay the top marginal rate on the majority of Alaska-sourced income

**Tax Base:**

Alaska taxable income begins with **federal taxable income** (as calculated on IRS Form 1120) and applies Alaska-specific modifications:
- **Add-backs**: Certain federal deductions disallowed for Alaska purposes
- **Subtractions**: Certain Alaska-specific deductions
- **Apportionment**: Alaska taxable income apportioned using modified three-factor formula (property, payroll, sales) for multistate corporations

**Critical Deductibility Rules:**

- **Alaska production tax**: **Deductible for federal corporate income tax** purposes (IRC §164 state tax deduction), reducing federal taxable income
- **Alaska production tax**: **NOT deductible** for Alaska state corporate income tax purposes (Alaska Statutes §43.20.021); Alaska taxable income calculated without deduction for Alaska production tax
- **Federal corporate income tax**: Not deductible for Alaska purposes

This non-deductibility creates a "tax on tax" effect, increasing the effective burden of Alaska's production tax.

**Apportionment Formula:**

For multistate petroleum companies, Alaska income is apportioned using a **three-factor formula** with special weighting:
- **Property factor**: Average Alaska property (tangible property) ÷ Total property everywhere
- **Payroll factor**: Alaska compensation ÷ Total compensation everywhere
- **Sales factor**: Alaska sales ÷ Total sales everywhere (petroleum production sales sourced to Alaska if production occurs in Alaska)

Alaska Apportionment Percentage = (Property Factor + Payroll Factor + Sales Factor) ÷ 3

Alaska Taxable Income = Federal Taxable Income (with Alaska modifications) × Alaska Apportionment %

Alaska Corporate Income Tax = Alaska Taxable Income × 9.4% (top rate)

#### 2.2.3 Property Tax and Royalties

**Property Tax:**

Alaska assesses property tax on petroleum property at the **state level** (unlike Texas, where property tax is local):
- **Valuation**: Petroleum property assessed at **full and true value** (fair market value)
- **Typical rate**: **20 mills** (2.0%) of assessed value (1 mill = 0.1%)
- **Assessment authority**: Alaska Department of Revenue, Tax Division conducts unified statewide assessment of oil and gas property (eliminates variability across local jurisdictions)
- **Tax base**: Exploration, production, and pipeline property; includes reserves, equipment, and infrastructure

**State Royalties:**

Alaska charges **royalties** on production from state-owned lands (state lands constitute the majority of North Slope production):
- **Minimum royalty rate**: **12.5%** of gross production value at the point of production
- **Enhanced royalty leases**: Some leases negotiated at higher rates, including **16.67%** (1/6th royalty)
- **Calculation**: Gross production value × Royalty rate (no deduction for costs)
- **Payment**: Royalties paid in-kind (delivery of oil to state) or in-value (cash payment)
- **Distinction from production tax**: Royalties are contractual payments for extraction rights; production tax is a sovereign tax on the privilege of production

**Combined Burden:**

Alaska's layered tax structure imposes:
1. State royalties (12.5% gross)
2. Production tax (35% net, reduced by credits)
3. State corporate income tax (9.4%)
4. Property tax (2.0%)
5. Federal corporate income tax (21%, with deductions for state taxes)

This creates effective government take rates significantly higher than Texas.

### 2.3 Other Major Producing States - Comparative Overview

| **State** | **Severance/Production Tax** | **State Corporate Income Tax** | **Key Features** |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| **Louisiana** | **12.5%** (oil); **15.975%** (gas) on gross value | **3.5% to 7.5%** graduated corporate income tax | Highest severance rates among major producers; severance tax deductible for federal income tax |
| **North Dakota** | **5% extraction tax** + **6.5% gross production tax** = 11.5% combined on gross value | **1.41% to 4.31%** graduated corporate income tax | Trigger price mechanism eliminated for most wells (2023); rates formerly reduced to 2% extraction tax when oil <$90/bbl |
| **Oklahoma** | **7%** gross production tax (oil and gas) | **4%** flat corporate income tax | Tax holidays: **48-month exemption** for new horizontal wells; reduced rates for certain production |
| **Wyoming** | **6%** severance tax (oil and gas) on gross value | **0%** (no corporate income tax) | No corporate income tax; relatively high property tax on petroleum reserves; substantial coal severance tax |
| **New Mexico** | **3.75%** severance tax + **0.19%** conservation tax = 3.94% combined on gross value | **5.9%** flat corporate income tax | Lower severance rates than most competitors; aggressive tax enforcement and audit practices |

**Key Observations:**

- **Gross vs. Net Systems**: Most states (Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Wyoming, New Mexico) impose **gross-based severance taxes** calculated on production value without cost deductions. Alaska uniquely employs a **net-based production tax** allowing deduction of capital and operating costs.

- **Rate Variation**: Severance tax rates range from 3.94% (New Mexico) to 15.975% (Louisiana gas), reflecting different state revenue needs, competitive positioning, and political priorities.

- **Income Tax Presence**: Texas, Wyoming, and South Dakota have no state corporate income tax; most other producing states impose income taxes ranging from 4% (Oklahoma) to 9.4% (Alaska).

## 3. Analytical Depth and Multi-State Issues

### 3.1 Nexus and Apportionment

**Physical Nexus:**

Production activities create **substantial nexus** triggering state tax obligations under the *Complete Auto Transit* test. Physical presence through wellhead operations, production equipment, pipelines, field offices, and employee activity establishes clear nexus for:
- Severance/production taxes (source-based; apply where production occurs)
- Corporate income taxes (apportioned based on activity factors)
- Property taxes (situs-based; apply where property is located)
- Franchise taxes (nexus-based; apply where substantial business activity occurs)

**Economic Nexus (Post-Wayfair):**

Following *South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.*, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018), states may establish nexus based on economic activity thresholds (e.g., $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions) without physical presence. For petroleum production companies, economic nexus standards are generally met through substantial sales revenue from production, though physical presence typically provides clear nexus.

**Apportionment Methods:**

States use different formulas to apportion multistate business income:

**Single-Factor (Sales/Receipts) Apportionment:**
- **Texas**: Uses single-factor receipts for franchise tax apportionment
- **Formula**: Texas Receipts ÷ Total Receipts = Texas Apportionment %
- **Petroleum application**: Production sales sourced to state where production occurs (Texas if wells in Texas)

**Three-Factor Apportionment (Property, Payroll, Sales):**
- **Alaska**: Uses three-factor formula for corporate income tax apportionment (equal weighting)
- **Formula**: (Property Factor + Payroll Factor + Sales Factor) ÷ 3 = Apportionment %
- **Petroleum application**: Wells, equipment, and pipelines create substantial property factor; field employees create payroll factor; production sales create sales factor

**Special Apportionment for Integrated Companies:**

Vertically integrated oil companies (upstream production, midstream transportation, downstream refining/marketing) may face special apportionment rules or separate accounting requirements to properly allocate income to production, transportation, refining, and retail activities across different states.

### 3.2 State Tax Credits and Incentives

**Texas Incentives:**

- **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) severance tax reduction**: Certified EOR projects receive severance tax reduction or exemption for incremental production attributable to EOR techniques; administered by Texas Railroad Commission
- **High-cost gas exemptions**: Natural gas wells with certified lifting costs exceeding $1.50/Mcf qualify for reduced severance tax rates on a sliding scale (rates may be reduced to 0% for highest-cost production)
- **Inactive well exemption**: Wells producing less than 10 barrels per day (or gas equivalent) for three consecutive months may qualify for severance tax exemption; encourages continued operation of marginal wells
- **Two-year exemption for certain recompletions**: Qualifying well recompletions may receive two-year severance tax exemption

**Alaska Incentives:**

- **Small producer credit**: $8 per barrel (maximum) for producers with average daily production below 50,000 bbl/day; phases down as oil prices increase; provides substantial relief for independent producers and Cook Inlet operators
- **Qualified Capital Expenditure (QCE) deductions**: Immediate deduction of capital costs against production tax (35% tax benefit) rather than capitalization and depreciation; incentivizes capital investment
- **New production credits**: Credits available for production from new participating areas or newly formed units
- **Hardship relief**: Alaska Department of Revenue may grant case-by-case production tax relief for fields demonstrating economic hardship; requires petition and review; limited application

**Policy Rationale:**

Tax incentives aim to:
- Encourage production from marginal wells that might otherwise be abandoned
- Incentivize enhanced recovery techniques extending field life
- Attract capital investment in new development
- Support independent producers competing with integrated majors
- Balance revenue needs with economic development objectives

### 3.3 Gross vs. Net Production Tax Systems - Comparative Analysis

**Gross Value Systems (Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota):**

**Structure**: Tax calculated as percentage of gross production value (production × price) without deduction for costs

**Advantages**:
- **Administrative simplicity**: Easy to calculate and audit; minimal compliance burden
- **Revenue stability**: State revenue flows immediately upon production regardless of profitability
- **Recession-proof**: Tax revenue maintained even during economic downturns or when operators experience losses

**Disadvantages**:
- **Burdens marginal production**: High-cost fields pay same rate as low-cost fields; can render marginal properties uneconomic
- **Pro-cyclical abandonment**: During price downturns, gross taxes can force premature well abandonment even when production remains physically viable
- **No incentive for cost efficiency**: Operators receive no tax benefit from reducing costs
- **Capital intensity penalty**: Capital-intensive projects (offshore, deep wells, EOR) bear full gross tax burden even during development phases with limited cash flow

**Net Value Systems (Alaska):**

**Structure**: Tax calculated as percentage of net production value (gross value minus qualified capital expenditures and lease expenditures)

**Advantages**:
- **Economic efficiency**: Taxes profits rather than gross revenue; aligns tax burden with economic returns
- **Protects marginal fields**: High-cost fields pay lower absolute tax; maintains viability of marginal production
- **Countercyclical stability**: During price downturns, net tax declines or eliminates automatically, preventing forced abandonment
- **Incentivizes investment**: Capital expenditures deductible against production tax; encourages development spending

**Disadvantages**:
- **Complex administration**: Requires detailed cost audits; significant compliance and enforcement costs
- **Revenue volatility**: State revenue fluctuates with profitability; low during price downturns
- **Delayed revenue**: Tax benefits from capital spending reduce immediate revenue
- **Cost inflation vulnerability**: Operators may inflate costs to reduce tax base; requires rigorous audit to prevent abuse
- **Gaming potential**: Transfer pricing, cost allocation, and intercompany charges create opportunities for tax planning

**Economic Impact on Investment Decisions:**

For a marginal project with gross revenue $100 million, operating costs $60 million, and capital costs $30 million:

**Gross System (5% rate)**:
- Tax = $100M × 5% = **$5M** (regardless of profitability)
- Pre-tax profit = $100M - $60M - $30M = $10M
- After-tax profit = $10M - $5M = **$5M** (50% effective tax rate on profit)

**Net System (35% rate)**:
- Net value = $100M - $60M - $30M = $10M
- Tax = $10M × 35% = **$3.5M**
- After-tax profit = $10M - $3.5M = **$6.5M** (35% effective tax rate on profit)

The net system provides lower absolute tax ($3.5M vs. $5M) and lower effective rate on profit (35% vs. 50%), making marginal projects more viable despite the higher nominal rate.

## 4. Application Methodology - Multi-State Tax Calculation Framework

**Step 1: Determine Nexus**

Identify all states where:
- Production occurs (creates severance/production tax nexus)
- Substantial business activity occurs (may create income tax nexus)
- Property is located (creates property tax situs)

**Step 2: Calculate State-Specific Production/Severance Taxes**

For each producing state:
- **Gross system states**: Gross Production Value × Severance Tax Rate
- **Net system states** (Alaska): (Gross Value - QCE - Lease Expenditures) × Production Tax Rate - Credits

**Step 3: Calculate State Corporate Income Taxes**

For states imposing corporate income tax:
- Calculate federal taxable income
- Apply state-specific modifications (add-backs and subtractions)
- Apportion income using state's apportionment formula
- Apply state tax rate to apportioned income
- Claim applicable credits

**Step 4: Calculate Property Taxes**

For each state/jurisdiction:
- Determine assessed value (market value × assessment ratio)
- Apply applicable tax rate
- Pay by jurisdiction's due date

**Step 5: Allocate Deductions for Federal Tax Purposes**

- State severance taxes: Deductible for federal corporate income tax (IRC §164)
- State income taxes: Deductible for federal corporate income tax
- State property taxes: Deductible for federal corporate income tax
- Note: Alaska production tax not deductible for Alaska state income tax

**Step 6: Calculate Federal Corporate Income Tax**

- Federal taxable income (after state tax deductions)
- Apply 21% federal rate
- Claim federal credits (foreign tax credits, section 45Q credits, etc.)

**Step 7: Aggregate Total Tax Burden**

Sum all taxes:
- Federal income tax
- State production/severance taxes
- State income taxes
- Property taxes
- Franchise taxes
- Royalties (if applicable; not a tax but treated similarly for economic analysis)

**Step 8: Calculate Effective Tax Rates**

- Effective rate on gross revenue = Total Taxes ÷ Gross Revenue
- Effective rate on pre-tax cash flow = Total Taxes ÷ (Revenue - Opex - Capex)
- Government take percentage = (Total Taxes + Royalties) ÷ Gross Revenue

## 5. Worked Example - Texas vs. Alaska Comparative Analysis

### 5.1 Fact Pattern

**PetroCompare Inc.** operates identical oil production facilities in two states for comparative analysis purposes:
- **Texas Facility**: Permian Basin production
- **Alaska Facility**: North Slope production

**Common Variables (2024 Tax Year):**
- **Annual production**: 3,650,000 barrels (both facilities)
- **Average daily production**: 10,000 barrels per day (qualifies for Alaska small producer credit)
- **Oil price**: $75 per barrel (ANS West Coast for Alaska; WTI-equivalent for Texas)
- **Gross revenue**: $273,750,000 (each facility)
- **Operating costs (lease expenditures)**: $100,000,000
- **Capital expenditures**: $50,000,000 (qualifies as QCE for Alaska; placed in service during year for Texas depreciation)
- **Depreciation (for income tax purposes)**: $10,000,000 per year (5-year straight-line for simplicity)
- **Transportation costs**: $5 per barrel = $18,250,000 (point of production to point of sale)

**Assumptions**:
- Texas: No state royalties (private land lease)
- Alaska: State lease with 12.5% royalty
- Both facilities operated by same parent company for federal tax purposes
- No percentage depletion (companies are integrated producers)
- Capital expenditures depreciated over 5 years for federal tax (simplified from MACRS for comparison purposes)

### 5.2 Texas Taxation

**Severance Tax:**

```
Market value at wellhead: $273,750,000 (gross revenue before transportation deduction)

Oil severance tax (4.6%): $273,750,000 × 4.6% = $12,592,500
Oil field cleanup fee (0.125%): $273,750,000 × 0.125% = $342,188
________________________________________________________________________
Total severance tax: $12,934,688
```

**Franchise Tax:**

```
Total revenue: $273,750,000
Less: Cost of goods sold (operating costs): ($100,000,000)
________________________________________________________________________
Taxable margin: $173,750,000

Texas apportionment (100% Texas production): 100%
Apportioned margin: $173,750,000

Franchise tax rate: 0.75%
Franchise tax: $173,750,000 × 0.75% = $1,303,125
```

**Property Tax:**

```
Assessed value of petroleum property: $200,000,000
(Includes present value of proved reserves plus equipment and facilities)

Average county/district property tax rate: 2.2%
Property tax: $200,000,000 × 2.2% = $4,400,000
```

### 5.3 Alaska Taxation

**Production Tax (Net-Based, 35%):**

```
Gross production value: $273,750,000

Less: Qualified capital expenditures (current year): ($50,000,000)
Less: Lease expenditures (operating costs): ($100,000,000)
Less: Transportation to point of sale: ($18,250,000)
________________________________________________________________________
Production tax value (PTV) before credits: $105,500,000

Production tax at 35% base rate: $105,500,000 × 35% = $36,925,000

Less: Small producer credit ($8/bbl for <50,000 bbl/day):
      3,650,000 barrels × $8/bbl = ($29,200,000)
________________________________________________________________________
Net production tax after credits: $7,725,000

Check minimum tax floor (4% of gross):
4% × $273,750,000 = $10,950,000
Net tax after credits ($7,725,000) < Minimum floor ($10,950,000)
Therefore: Production tax = $10,950,000 (minimum floor applies)

### 5.5 Key Insights

**1. Alaska's Substantially Higher Government Take:**

Despite Alaska's net-based production tax (theoretically more economically efficient), **total government take is 12.76 percentage points higher** (29.30% vs. 16.54%) due primarily to:
- **State royalties**: 12.50% of gross revenue ($34.2 million) – Texas facility on private land pays private royalty to lessor (not included in government take)
- **State income tax**: 9.4% rate generates $13.7 million; Texas has no state income tax
- **Combined layering**: Multiple gross-based charges (royalties, property tax, minimum production tax floor) plus net-based production tax creates cumulative burden

**2. Small Producer Credit Impact:**

Alaska's small producer credit provides critical relief:
- **Production tax before credit**: $36,925,000 (35% of $105.5M net value)
- **Small producer credit**: $29,200,000 ($8/bbl × 3.65M bbls)
- **Net production tax after credit**: $7,725,000
- **Minimum floor override**: $10,950,000 (4% of gross)
- **Credit benefit**: $26,000,000 reduction (though limited by minimum floor)

Without the small producer credit and minimum floor, production tax would be $36,925,000, increasing total Alaska burden to $106.2M (38.8% effective rate) – making many Alaska projects uneconomic.

**3. Federal Tax Interaction (Deductibility Effect):**

- **Texas federal tax**: $26,641,059
- **Alaska federal tax**: $17,357,393
- **Difference**: $9,283,666 lower federal tax for Alaska operations

Alaska's higher state taxes and royalties generate larger federal tax deductions (IRC §164), reducing federal tax liability. This federal tax savings partially offsets (but does not eliminate) Alaska's higher state burden:
- **Alaska additional state burden**: +$34.9M
- **Alaska federal tax savings**: -$9.3M
- **Net additional burden**: +$25.6M

The federal deductibility provides approximately **27% offset** of Alaska's incremental state burden.

**4. Capital Expenditure Treatment:**

- **Alaska**: Immediate deduction of $50M QCE against production tax generates $17.5M production tax benefit (35% × $50M), though limited by small producer credit interaction
- **Texas**: No severance tax relief for capital expenditures; capex depreciated for income tax only over multiple years

Alaska's immediate QCE deduction encourages capital investment by providing upfront tax benefits, while Texas provides no severance tax incentive for capital spending.

**5. Net vs. Gross System Impact:**

At $75/bbl oil price with substantial operating and capital costs:
- **Alaska net system**: Allows cost deductions, reducing tax base from $273.75M gross to $105.5M net (61% reduction)
- **Texas gross system**: No cost deductions; severance tax applies to full gross value

The net system protects profitability during high-cost or low-margin operations, while the gross system maintains state revenue regardless of operator profitability.

**6. Marginal Project Economics:**

For this moderately profitable project:
- **Texas after-tax return**: $46.2M profit on $273.75M revenue = **16.9% margin**
- **Alaska after-tax return**: $11.5M profit on $273.75M revenue = **4.2% margin**

Alaska's higher burden reduces after-tax profitability by **75%** compared to Texas ($46.2M → $11.5M), potentially rendering marginal projects uneconomic and deterring investment despite Alaska's theoretically superior net-based tax design.

**7. Breakeven Analysis:**

At $75/bbl, Alaska operations remain profitable ($11.5M profit). However, a price decline to approximately **$65-70/bbl** would eliminate Alaska profitability entirely, while Texas operations would remain profitable above approximately **$55-60/bbl** due to lower government take.

## 6. Constitutional and Legal Framework

### 6.1 Complete Auto Transit Test (Commerce Clause Analysis)

State petroleum taxes must satisfy the four-part test established in *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady*, 430 U.S. 274 (1977):

**1. Substantial Nexus:**
- Petroleum production operations create clear substantial nexus through physical presence (wells, equipment, facilities) within state boundaries
- Post-*Wayfair* economic nexus standards (sales thresholds) also satisfied by substantial production revenue

**2. Fair Apportionment:**
- **Internal consistency**: Tax must be structured so that if every state applied identical tax, no multiple taxation would result
- **External consistency**: Tax must fairly reflect taxpayer's activity within taxing state
- Severance taxes satisfy apportionment by taxing only production physically extracted within state
- Income taxes satisfy apportionment through apportionment formulas allocating income to states based on activity factors

**3. Non-Discrimination:**
- Tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of local commerce
- Petroleum severance taxes apply equally to in-state and out-of-state operators
- May not favor in-state refiners over out-of-state purchasers

**4. Fair Relationship to State Services:**
- Tax must be fairly related to services provided by state to taxpayer
- State provision of regulatory oversight, infrastructure (roads), legal system, and resource management satisfies this requirement
- Tax need not precisely correspond to services received; general relationship sufficient

### 6.2 Supremacy Clause Limitations

**Federal Preemption:**

State taxes on federal land production are preempted by federal supremacy:
- **Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)**: Federal jurisdiction beyond 3 nautical miles; states may not impose severance taxes on OCS production
- **Federal onshore lands**: States may not impose severance taxes on production from federal mineral estate; operators may owe state income tax on net income from federal operations

**Federal Enclaves:**

Production on certain federal enclaves (military bases, national parks) may be subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction precluding state taxation.

### 6.3 Due Process Requirements

State taxation must satisfy Fourteenth Amendment Due Process minimum contacts requirement:
- Lower threshold than Commerce Clause substantial nexus
- Physical production operations within state clearly satisfy Due Process
- Notice and opportunity to contest assessments required

**Study Note Key Points:**

1. **Dual sovereignty system**: Federal and state governments possess independent taxing authority over petroleum extraction; no constitutional preemption of state petroleum taxes on state-owned or private minerals

2. **Texas tax structure**: **4.6% oil severance tax** + **0.125% cleanup fee** = 4.725% combined; **7.5% gas severance tax**; **0.75% franchise tax** on margin; **no state income tax**; local property taxes (~2.0-2.5%)

3. **Alaska tax structure**: **35% production tax** on net value (gross minus QCE and lease expenditures); **9.4% top corporate income tax** rate; **2.0% property tax**; **12.5% minimum state royalty**; combined effective rate substantially higher than Texas

4. **Senate Bill 21 (Alaska)**: Enacted **2013**, replaced ACES (25% base + progressivity) with flat **35% rate**; introduced **$8/bbl small producer credit** for production <50,000 bbl/day; **minimum tax floor 4%** of gross value

5. **Texas franchise tax threshold**: Increased to **$2.47 million** total revenue (2024) by Senate Bill 3 (enacted 2023); entities below threshold owe no franchise tax and need not file

6. **Gross vs. net systems**: Gross systems (Texas, most states) tax production value without cost deductions; **simple but burden marginal production**. Net systems (Alaska) allow cost deductions; **economically efficient but complex**

7. **Small producer credit impact**: Alaska's $8/bbl credit reduces production tax by up to $29.2M in worked example; critical for economic viability of smaller operators; without credit, Alaska effective rate would approach 39%

8. **Constitutional limitations**: *Complete Auto Transit* four-part test (substantial nexus, fair apportionment, non-discrimination, fair relationship to services); Supremacy Clause prevents state taxation of federal mineral production

9. **Federal tax deductibility**: State taxes (severance, income, property) deductible for federal corporate income tax (IRC §164); Alaska production tax **not deductible** for Alaska state income tax (creates "tax on tax" effect)

10. **Comparative effective rates**: Texas **16.5%** total effective rate (excluding private royalties); Alaska **29.3%** including state royalties (16.8% taxes only); Alaska's 12.76 percentage point higher burden primarily due to **12.5% state royalty** + **9.4% state income tax** vs. Texas's zero income tax

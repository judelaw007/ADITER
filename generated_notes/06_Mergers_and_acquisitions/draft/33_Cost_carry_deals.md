## Topic 33: Mergers and Acquisitions
### Cost Carry Deals

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Nature of Cost Carry Arrangements

A **cost carry** (also called **carry agreement** or **farm-in arrangement**) is a specialized financing structure unique to the oil and gas industry where one party (the **carrying party** or **farmee**) agrees to pay all or a portion of another party's (**carried party** or **farmor**) share of exploration, development, or production costs in exchange for earning an interest in the petroleum license or project.

Unlike traditional acquisitions where consideration is paid upfront in cash, cost carry deals involve:

- **No upfront cash payment** (or minimal payment)
- **Earning interest** through funding exploration/development costs
- **Risk sharing** between parties
- **Deferred economic benefit** realization

### 1.2 Commercial Rationale

Cost carry structures arise when:

**From Farmor's Perspective:**
- Farmor holds valuable acreage but **lacks capital** for exploration
- Farmor seeks to **derisk** holdings before committing own funds
- Farmor wants to **retain partial interest** in upside potential

**From Farmee's Perspective:**
- Farmee seeks **entry into new basins** or countries
- Farmee has **technical expertise** and capital
- Farmee prefers **contingent consideration** (only pays if resources discovered)

### 1.3 Tax Complexity and Exam Focus

Cost carry deals present unique tax challenges:

- **Timing of consideration**: When is value transferred for tax purposes?
- **Characterization**: Is it a sale, a joint venture contribution, or a service arrangement?
- **Cost recovery**: How are carried costs treated under PSCs and fiscal regimes?
- **Farmor's gain recognition**: When and how is gain/income recognized?
- **Farmee's deductions**: Are carried costs immediately deductible or capitalized?

This advanced-level topic requires detailed understanding of tax treatment in both asset-based and PSC regimes.

## 2. Structure and Mechanics of Cost Carry Deals

### 2.1 Typical Farm-In/Farm-Out Structure

#### 2.1.1 Basic Carry Agreement Terms

**Example Structure:**

```
Farmor holds: 100% working interest in License Block A

Farm-In Agreement:
- Farmee earns 60% working interest in Block A by:
  (a) Paying Farmor's 40% share of costs for drilling 3 exploration wells
  (b) Paying Farmee's own 60% share of costs
  (c) Total: Farmee funds 100% of well costs

- If commercial discovery made:
  - Farmee earns 60% interest
  - Farmor retains 40% interest (carried through exploration)

- If no commercial discovery:
  - Farmee has spent exploration costs
  - Farmor gives up nothing (retains 100%)
```

**Key Terms:**

**Carry Obligation:**
```
"Farmee shall pay 100% of the costs of drilling, completing, and testing the Commitment Wells,
including Farmor's 40% proportionate share. Farmee's carry obligation shall not exceed
$50,000,000 (Hard Cap)."
```

**Earning Threshold:**
```
"Upon (a) drilling 3 wells to total depth, (b) spending at least $50M, and (c) declaration of
commerciality by Farmee, Farmee shall have earned a 60% participating interest in the License."
```

#### 2.1.2 Carry Types

**Full Carry (100% Carry):**
- Farmee pays **all costs** (both parties' shares)
- Farmor pays **nothing**

**Partial Carry (e.g., 2-for-1):**
```
"Farmee shall pay 2× its proportionate share of costs. For every $1 of costs incurred,
Farmee funds $2 and Farmor funds $0, until Farmee has spent $100M, after which costs
are shared proportionately (60% Farmee, 40% Farmor)."
```

**Stepped Carry (Phased):**
```
Phase 1 (Exploration): Farmee carries Farmor 100%
Phase 2 (Appraisal): Farmee carries Farmor 50%
Phase 3 (Development): Costs shared pro rata
```

### 2.2 Commerciality and Earning Interest

#### 2.2.1 Commerciality Declaration

```
"Commercial Discovery" means a discovery of hydrocarbons which, in the reasonable opinion
of Farmee (acting as a prudent operator), can be developed and produced commercially,
considering:
(a) Reservoir characteristics and recoverable reserves
(b) Development costs and infrastructure requirements
(c) Oil/gas prices and fiscal terms
(d) Economic return thresholds (minimum 15% IRR)"
```

**Tax Significance:**
- **Commerciality declaration triggers** transfer of interest to Farmee
- **Valuation date** for determining farmor's taxable gain
- **"Free carry"** through production vs. "back-in" rights after payout

#### 2.2.2 Promoting to Working Interest

**Before Commerciality:**
- Farmee holds **option** to earn interest (not yet a working interest owner)
- Farmor remains **100% owner** for tax and regulatory purposes

**After Commerciality:**
- **Interest transfer occurs**: 60% to Farmee, 40% retained by Farmor
- **Joint Operating Agreement (JOA)** becomes effective
- Parties share costs **pro rata** going forward (unless further carry applies)

---

## 3. Tax Treatment: Farmor (Carried Party)

### 3.1 Gain Recognition and Timing

#### 3.1.1 Realization Event

**When does Farmor recognize taxable gain?**

**General Principle:** Gain is realized when:
- Farmee completes carry obligation, **and**
- Commerciality is declared, **and**
- Interest is formally transferred/earned

**Timing Issues:**

**View 1: Immediate Recognition (Transfer Date)**
- Gain recognized when Farmee's interest vests (commerciality + carry completion)
- Amount: FMV of interest transferred less basis

**View 2: Deferred Recognition (Production Method)**
- If farm-out qualifies as **"non-recognition transaction"** (e.g., contribution to partnership/JV)
- Gain deferred until production revenues received

**View 3: Partial Recognition (Proportion of Costs)**
- Recognize gain ratably as Farmee incurs carried costs
- More complex, rarely used

**Most jurisdictions: View 1 (immediate recognition upon interest transfer)**

#### 3.1.2 Calculation of Gain

**Formula:**
```
Farmor's Gain = FMV of Interest Transferred - Adjusted Basis in Transferred Interest
```

**Example:**

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Farmor's original basis in 100% license | $10M |
| Farmor's basis in 60% transferred | $10M × 60% = $6M |
| FMV of 60% interest at commerciality | $80M |
| **Farmor's Gain** | **$80M - $6M = $74M** |

**FMV Determination:**
- Independent reserve valuation
- Comparable arm's length transactions
- Discounted cash flow of proved reserves

#### 3.1.3 Character of Gain

**Ordinary Income vs. Capital Gain:**

**US Tax Treatment:**
- If Farmor is **dealer** in oil/gas interests: **Ordinary income**
- If Farmor is **investor** holding for production: **Capital gain** (Section 1231 property)

**UK Tax Treatment:**
- Disposal of petroleum license interest: **Capital gain** (unless trading activity)
- **Ring fence** rules may affect treatment

### 3.2 Carried Costs as Consideration

#### 3.2.1 Inclusion in Amount Realized

Farmor's **amount realized** includes:
- **Cash received** (if any upfront payment)
- **FMV of carried costs** incurred by Farmee

**Example:**
```
Farmee completes carry by spending $50M on Farmor's behalf.

Farmor's Amount Realized:
- Cash received: $0
- FMV of carried costs: $50M
- FMV of other consideration: $0
Total Amount Realized: $50M
```

However, **valuation issue arises**: Is the $50M of carried costs equal to the FMV of the 60% interest earned?

**Typically, no:**
- $50M carried costs ≠ FMV of 60% interest
- FMV of 60% interest may be $80M (if reserves proven valuable)
- Or $30M (if well marginally commercial)

**Tax authorities may recharacterize** using FMV of interest transferred, not carried costs incurred.

#### 3.2.2 Tax Reporting Obligations

**US: Form 1099-B (Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions)**
- Farmor must report gain on tax return
- Farmee may issue 1099 if carrying costs > $600

**UK: Corporation Tax Return**
- Chargeable gain reported in CT600
- Include details of farm-out transaction

---

## 4. Tax Treatment: Farmee (Carrying Party)

### 4.1 Capitalization vs. Deduction of Carried Costs

#### 4.1.1 General Rule: Capitalize

Carried costs paid by Farmee are **capital expenditures** incurred to acquire an interest in the license:

**US Tax Treatment:**
- **Geological & Geophysical (G&G) costs**: Amortized over 24 months (US Internal Revenue Code Section 167(h))
- **Intangible Drilling Costs (IDCs)**: Election to expense immediately or capitalize and deplete (US Internal Revenue Code Section 263(c))
- **Tangible equipment costs**: Capitalize and depreciate over MACRS recovery period

**UK Tax Treatment:**
- **Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement (RFES)**: Uplift of 10% per year on unrelieved expenditures (pre-production costs)
- Exploration costs: Deductible against ring fence profits when incurred

#### 4.1.2 IDC Election (US)

For **domestic wells**, Farmee can elect to **immediately expense IDCs**:

**Example:**
Farmee spends $50M on 3 exploration wells:
- IDCs (wages, mud, drilling services): $40M
- Tangible costs (casing, wellhead equipment): $10M

**Election to expense IDCs:**
- Deduct $40M immediately in Year 1
- Capitalize $10M tangible costs, depreciate over 7 years (MACRS)

**Tax savings (Year 1):**
- $40M deduction × 21% corporate rate = **$8.4M tax saved**

**If no commerciality (dry holes):**
- $50M costs deducted/depreciated with **no corresponding income**
- Farmee bears **full economic loss** (no interest earned)

### 4.2 Basis in Earned Interest

#### 4.2.1 Cost Basis Calculation

Farmee's **tax basis** in the earned 60% interest equals total costs incurred:

```
Basis = Carried Costs Paid + Direct Acquisition Costs

Example:
- Carried costs (Farmor's 40% share): $20M
- Farmee's own 60% share of costs: $30M
- Legal fees, due diligence: $1M
Total Basis in 60% Interest: $51M
```

#### 4.2.2 Allocation of Basis

Basis must be allocated among:
- **Proved developed producing (PDP) reserves**: Cost depletion as production occurs
- **Proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves**: Cost depletion when developed and produced
- **Unproved acreage**: If commercial discovery, allocated to reserves; if dry, written off

**Example:**

| Asset | Allocation | Depletion Method |
|---|---|---|
| PDP reserves (10M boe) | $30M | $3 per boe cost depletion |
| PUD reserves (15M boe) | $15M | $1 per boe (developed later) |
| Lease acquisition cost | $6M | Amortized over lease term or depleted |
| **Total Basis** | **$51M** | |

## 5. PSC Regime Considerations

### 5.1 Cost Recovery Treatment of Carried Costs

#### 5.1.1 Contractor's Cost Pool

Under **Production Sharing Contracts**, carried costs present unique issues:

**Question:** Do carried costs qualify as **recoverable costs** under the PSC?

**General Rule:**
- Costs incurred **for exploration, development, and production** are recoverable
- **Acquisition costs** (including farm-in payments) are typically **non-recoverable**

**Carried Costs Analysis:**

**If Farmee carries Farmor's share of drilling costs:**
- Costs are **operational in nature** (drilling, completing wells)
- **Should be recoverable** as cost oil (subject to cost oil ceiling)

**However, PSC may require:**
- **Government approval** of carry arrangement
- Costs must be **at arm's length** (no inflated costs to increase cost oil)
- **Apportionment**: Only Farmee's **earned share** of costs may be recoverable (not full 100% if interest < 100%)

#### 5.1.2 Example - Indonesia PSC

**Facts:**
- Farmor holds 100% PSC interest
- Farmee earns 60% by funding $100M of exploration costs (carrying Farmor's 40% share)

**Cost Recovery:**

**Farmee's Cost Pool:**
- Costs incurred by Farmee: **$100M**
- Farmee's earned interest: **60%**

**Issue:** Can Farmee recover **100% of costs** or only **60% (proportionate share)**?

**Indonesian Practice:**
- Costs allocated **pro rata** to working interest
- Farmee recovers $100M × 60% = **$60M** from cost oil
- Remaining $40M (Farmor's share) is **not recoverable by Farmee**

**Impact:**
- Farmee effectively "loses" $40M economic benefit (paid but not recovered)
- Farmor receives **free carry** with no cost oil deduction (beneficial to Farmor)

### 5.2 Transfer Pricing and Arm's Length Issues

#### 5.2.1 Related Party Carries

If Farmor and Farmee are **related parties** (e.g., subsidiaries of same parent), tax authorities may scrutinize:

**Transfer Pricing Concerns:**
- Are carried costs **inflated** to shift profits?
- Does the farm-in structure have **economic substance**?
- Is the interest transferred at **fair market value**?

**Example - Aggressive Structure:**
```
Parent Corp (Country A) holds PSC through Subsidiary 1 (Country B - low tax)

Parent creates Subsidiary 2 (Country B) and enters "carry agreement":
- Sub 2 "earns" 80% interest by "carrying" Sub 1
- Sub 2 inflates drilling costs to $200M (actual: $100M)
- Sub 2 recovers $200M × 80% = $160M from cost oil
- Profit shifted to Sub 2 through inflated cost recovery
```

**Tax Authority Response:**
- **Disallow inflated costs** from cost oil recovery
- **Recharacterize** transaction as non-arm's length
- **Impose penalties** for transfer pricing violation

## 6. Worked Examples

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Simple Farm-Out with Capital Gain

**Facts:**

Farmor Oil Company holds **100% working interest** in License Block X. Farmor's original cost to acquire the license: **$5 million**.

**Farm-Out Agreement:**
- Farmee Energy will earn **70% working interest** by:
  - Drilling 2 exploration wells
  - Carrying Farmor's 30% share of costs
  - Total well costs estimated: **$40 million**

**Actual Performance:**
- Farmee drills 2 wells, total cost: **$45 million** (above estimate)
- Farmee's 70% share: $45M × 70% = **$31.5M**
- Farmor's 30% share (carried): $45M × 30% = **$13.5M**
- **Total carried by Farmee: $45M** (100% of costs)

**Commerciality:**
- Farmee declares commerciality on December 31, Year 2
- Independent valuation determines **FMV of 70% interest = $90 million**

**Tax Rates:**
- Farmor's capital gains rate: **20%**
- Ordinary income rate: **35%**

**Required:**

1. Calculate Farmor's **taxable gain** on farm-out
2. Determine **character of gain** (ordinary vs. capital)
3. Calculate Farmor's **tax liability**
4. Determine Farmee's **tax basis** in the earned 70% interest
5. Discuss **timing of gain recognition**

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Farmor's Taxable Gain**

**Interest Transferred:** 70% of License Block X

**Farmor's Adjusted Basis in 70% Interest:**
```
Original cost basis in 100%: $5M
Basis in 70% transferred: $5M × 70% = $3.5M
```

**Amount Realized:**
```
FMV of 70% interest at commerciality: $90M
```

**Taxable Gain:**
```
Amount Realized:   $90.0M
Less: Basis:        -3.5M
Taxable Gain:      $86.5M
```

**Part 2: Character of Gain**

Assuming Farmor is an **investor holding for production** (not a dealer trading oil/gas interests):

- Disposal of petroleum license = **Section 1231 property** (US) or **capital asset** (general)
- **Character: Long-term capital gain** (if held > 1 year)

**Part 3: Tax Liability**

```
Capital Gain:        $86.5M
Tax Rate:            20%
Tax Liability:       $86.5M × 20% = $17.3M
```

**Farmor's After-Tax Position:**
```
FMV of Retained Interest (30% of Block X):
  Total Block value = $90M ÷ 70% = $128.6M
  Farmor's 30% = $128.6M × 30% = $38.6M

Less: Tax paid:       -17.3M
Less: Original basis:  -5.0M (sunk cost, already spent)

Net Economic Position: $38.6M value - $17.3M tax
                     = $21.3M net value (on original $5M investment)
```

**Part 4: Farmee's Tax Basis**

Farmee's basis in the earned 70% interest:

```
Total costs incurred: $45M
  (includes Farmee's 70% share + Farmor's carried 30% share)

Basis in 70% Interest: $45M
```

**Alternative View (Allocate Costs):**
- Some tax authorities argue basis = only costs attributable to earned interest
- Here: $45M all attributable to drilling on Block X → full $45M is basis

**Depletion Calculation (Future):**

Assume 70% interest contains **15 million barrels** proved reserves.

**Cost Depletion Rate:**
```
Cost Depletion = $45M ÷ 15M bbls = $3 per barrel
```

Each barrel produced, Farmee deducts $3 cost depletion.

**Part 5: Timing of Gain Recognition**

**When is Farmor's $86.5M gain recognized?**

**Tax Principles:**
- Gain realized when interest **transfers** to Farmee
- Transfer occurs upon **commerciality declaration** (December 31, Year 2)

**Farmor's Tax Year:**
- Gain reported in **Year 2 tax return** (year of commerciality declaration)
- Even though carried costs were incurred over Year 1-2, gain recognition is **one-time event** at transfer

**Deferral Opportunities:**
- If farm-out structured as **contribution to partnership/JV**, may qualify for non-recognition under US Internal Revenue Code Section 721
- Requires forming partnership and receiving partnership interest (not direct working interest)

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2: Partial Carry with Cost Recovery in PSC

**Facts:**

**License:** Production Sharing Contract in Country Z, held 100% by Farmor Inc.

**PSC Terms:**
- Cost recovery ceiling: **60%** of gross revenues
- Profit oil split: **50% Contractor / 50% Government**
- Corporate tax: **30%** (paid by Government from its profit oil share)

**Farm-In Agreement:**
- Farmee earns **60% participating interest** by:
  - Funding **80% of first $50M** of development costs (Partial Carry)
  - Funding **60% of all subsequent costs** (pro rata)

**Development Costs (Year 1-2):**

| Year | Total Costs | Farmee Pays | Farmor Pays |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $40M | $40M × 80% = $32M | $40M × 20% = $8M |
| 2 | $30M | $30M × 80% = $24M | $30M × 20% = $6M |
| **Subtotal (Carry Period)** | **$70M** | **$56M** | **$14M** |
| 3 (Production) | $20M | $20M × 60% = $12M | $20M × 40% = $8M |

**Farmee's Total Carry:** $56M - ($70M × 60%) = $56M - $42M = **$14M carried**

(Alternatively: Farmee paid $56M for 60% interest; pro-rata share would be $42M; carry = $14M)

**Production (Year 3):**
- Gross revenues: **$100M** (60% interest = $60M to contractors)
- Operating costs: **$20M**

**Farmor's original basis in PSC:** $5M

**Required:**

1. Calculate **cost oil recovery** for each party in Year 3
2. Determine **profit oil allocation**
3. Calculate **Farmor's taxable gain** on farm-out
4. Analyze **Farmee's cost recovery position**

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Cost Oil Recovery (Year 3)**

**Total Unrecovered Costs (Beginning Year 3):**

| Party | Year 1 Costs | Year 2 Costs | Total Unrecovered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Farmee | $32M | $24M | $56M |
| Farmor | $8M | $6M | $14M |
| **Total Pool** | **$40M** | **$30M** | **$70M** |

**Year 3 Cost Recovery:**

**Gross Revenue (100% basis):** $100M
**Cost Oil Ceiling:** $100M × 60% = **$60M**

**Costs to Recover:**
- Year 3 operating costs: $20M (priority recovery)
- Remaining capacity: $60M - $20M = **$40M** available for capex recovery

**Cost Oil Allocation (Pro Rata to Unrecovered Costs):**

| Party | Unrecovered Capex | % of Pool | Capex Recovery | Opex Recovery | Total Cost Oil |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Farmee (60%) | $56M | 80% | $32M | $12M | $44M |
| Farmor (40%) | $14M | 20% | $8M | $8M | $16M |
| **Total** | **$70M** | 100% | **$40M** | **$20M** | **$60M** |

**Remaining Unrecovered Costs (End Year 3):**
- Farmee: $56M - $32M = **$24M** (carry forward to Year 4)
- Farmor: $14M - $8M = **$6M**

**Part 2: Profit Oil Allocation**

**Profit Oil (Year 3):**
```
Gross Revenue:     $100M
Less: Cost Oil:     -60M
Profit Oil:         $40M
```

**Split:**
- Contractors (50%): $40M × 50% = **$20M**
- Government (50%): $40M × 50% = **$20M**

**Contractors' Share Allocation (Pro Rata to Working Interest):**
- Farmee (60%): $20M × 60% = **$12M**
- Farmor (40%): $20M × 40% = **$8M**

**Total Cash to Each Party (Year 3):**

| Party | Cost Oil | Profit Oil | Total Cash | Tax (30%, paid by Govt) | Net Cash |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Farmee | $44M | $12M | $56M | $0 (Govt pays) | $56M |
| Farmor | $16M | $8M | $24M | $0 (Govt pays) | $24M |

**Part 3: Farmor's Taxable Gain on Farm-Out**

**Valuation of 60% Interest Transferred:**

Method 1: Capitalized Cash Flow

Assume steady state: Year 3 represents typical production.

**Farmee's Cash Flow (60% interest):**
- Annual cash: $56M (Year 3 example)
- Assume 10-year production life, 10% discount

```
PV of Future Cash Flows = $56M × 6.145 (PV annuity factor, 10%, 10 years)
                        = $344M

Add: Unrecovered costs (tax asset): $24M
FMV of 60% Interest ≈ $368M
```

Method 2: Industry Multiples (Simplified)

Assume $15/boe valuation for proved reserves.

If 60% interest contains 20M boe:
```
FMV = 20M boe × $15 = $300M
```

**Use $300M as FMV** (conservative estimate).

**Farmor's Gain:**
```
FMV of 60% transferred:  $300M
Less: Basis (60% of $5M): -$3M
Taxable Gain:            $297M
```

**Tax Impact:**
- Capital gain: $297M
- Tax at 20%: **$59.4M**

**Farmor's Net Position:**
```
Retained Interest (40% value): $300M × (40/60) = $200M
Less: Tax paid:                 -59.4M
Less: Out-of-pocket costs:      -14M (Year 1-2 costs paid by Farmor)
Net Economic Position:          $126.6M
```

Compare to original $5M investment: **$121.6M net gain** (2,432% ROI).

**Part 4: Farmee's Cost Recovery Analysis**

**Farmee's Total Investment:**
```
Year 1-2 capex:     $56M
Year 3 opex:        $12M (60% share)
Total Invested:     $68M
```

**Cost Recovery (Year 3):**
```
Cost oil recovered: $44M
Remaining unrecovered: $24M (to recover in future years)
```

**Cash-on-Cash Return (Year 3 Only):**
```
Cash received (Year 3): $56M
Less: Opex paid:        -12M
Net Cash (Year 3):      $44M

Cumulative Investment: $68M
Cumulative Recovery:   $44M
Net Unrecovered:       $24M (expected recovery Years 4+)
```

**Payback Period:** Approximately 2-3 years (assuming similar production continues).

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3: Dry Hole - Failed Carry with Tax Loss

**Facts:**

Farmee Oil Corp enters farm-in agreement with Farmor Ltd.

**Terms:**
- Farmee to earn **100% working interest** in License Area Q by:
  - Drilling 3 exploration wells
  - Carrying Farmor's 100% share of costs (Farmor pays nothing)

**Performance:**
- Farmee drills 3 wells over 18 months
- Total costs incurred: **$75 million**
  - IDCs: $60M
  - Tangible equipment: $15M

**Result:**
- All 3 wells are **dry holes** (no commercial hydrocarbons discovered)
- Farmee **earns no interest** (farm-in fails)
- Farmor retains 100% interest in License (but license has diminished value)

**Tax Positions:**
- Farmee's corporate tax rate: **21%** (US)
- Farmee elects to **immediately expense IDCs** (domestic wells)
- Farmor's capital gains rate: **15%**

**Required:**

1. Calculate Farmee's **tax deductions** from the failed farm-in
2. Determine Farmee's **net economic loss** after tax benefits
3. Analyze Farmor's **tax position** (gain or loss on failed farm-in)
4. Discuss **at-risk and passive loss limitations** (if applicable)

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Farmee's Tax Deductions**

**Immediate Deductions (Year 1-2):**

**IDCs (Intangible Drilling Costs):**
```
IDCs incurred: $60M
Farmee elects immediate expensing (US Internal Revenue Code Section 263(c))
Deduction (Years 1-2): $60M
```

**Tangible Equipment:**
```
Tangible costs: $15M
Capitalized and depreciated over 7 years (MACRS)

Year 1 depreciation: $15M × 14.29% = $2.14M
Year 2 depreciation: $15M × 24.49% = $3.67M
Years 3-8: Remaining depreciation
```

**Dry Hole Loss:**

Once wells are determined to be dry holes, any **remaining tangible equipment basis** can be **written off as abandonment loss**:

```
Tangible equipment:              $15.00M
Less: Depreciation claimed (Yrs 1-2): -$5.81M
Remaining basis:                 $9.19M

Abandonment loss deduction (Year 2): $9.19M
```

**Total Deductions:**

| Year | IDC Expense | Depreciation | Abandonment Loss | Total Deduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $40M | $2.14M | $0 | $42.14M |
| 2 | $20M | $3.67M | $9.19M | $32.86M |
| **Total** | **$60M** | **$5.81M** | **$9.19M** | **$75M** |

**Tax Savings:**
```
Total deductions: $75M
Tax rate: 21%
Tax savings: $75M × 21% = $15.75M
```

**Part 2: Farmee's Net Economic Loss**

```
Total Costs Incurred:     $75.00M
Less: Tax Savings:        -15.75M
Net After-Tax Loss:       $59.25M
```

**Earned Interest:** **Zero** (dry holes, no commercial discovery)

**Economic Outcome:**
- Farmee **lost $59.25M** (after tax) with **no interest earned**
- This is the **risk** in carry agreements: all costs, no guarantee of success

**Part 3: Farmor's Tax Position**

**Farmor's Activity:**
- Incurred **no costs** (fully carried by Farmee)
- Retains **100% interest** in License (no transfer)
- **No taxable event** (no income, no disposition)

**Farmor's Economic Position:**
- Still owns 100% of License
- License **value diminished** (3 dry holes reduce prospectivity)
- But Farmor spent **nothing**, risked **nothing**

**No Tax Consequence for Farmor:**
- No gain/loss recognized (no disposition occurred)
- Original basis in License remains ($5M, if that was original cost)

**Potential Future Deduction:**

If License is later **abandoned or sold for less than basis**:
```
If License sold for $1M:
Basis: $5M
Loss: $4M (capital loss, assuming held for investment)
```

**Part 4: At-Risk and Passive Loss Limitations**

**At-Risk Rules (US Internal Revenue Code Section 465):**

Farmee's $75M loss deductions are subject to **at-risk limitation**:

- Deductions limited to **amount at risk** (investment plus liabilities for which taxpayer is personally liable)
- If Farmee used **non-recourse debt** to fund drilling, deductions may be limited

**Example:**
```
Farmee's Funding:
- Equity invested: $30M
- Recourse bank loan: $25M (Farmee personally liable)
- Non-recourse loan: $20M (secured only by License assets)

Amount At Risk:
- Equity: $30M
- Recourse debt: $25M
- Non-recourse debt: $0 (not at risk)
Total At Risk: $55M

Maximum Deduction (Year 1-2): $55M (not full $75M)
Excess $20M deductions suspended until:
  (a) Additional at-risk investment made, or
  (b) Non-recourse debt converted to recourse
```

**Passive Loss Rules (US Internal Revenue Code Section 469):**

If Farmee is a **passive investor** (not actively managing drilling operations):

- Passive losses can only offset **passive income**
- Cannot offset **active business income** or **portfolio income**
- Excess passive losses **carried forward** indefinitely

**However:**
- If Farmee is an **oil and gas operator** (active in the trade/business), losses are **not passive**
- Full deduction allowed (subject only to at-risk rules)

**Typical Outcome:**
- Major oil companies (active operators): **Not subject to passive loss rules**
- Individual investors or financial investors: **May be limited by passive loss rules**

**Conclusion:**

Despite $59.25M net loss, Farmee may have **strategic reasons** for the farm-in:

1. **Technical Data:** Farmee gained subsurface knowledge (seismic interpretation, well logs)
2. **Relationship:** Built relationship with Farmor for future opportunities
3. **Portfolio Strategy:** 1-in-3 exploration success rate is industry norm; Farmee may succeed on next farm-in

Farmor suffered **no loss** (no costs incurred, retains license).

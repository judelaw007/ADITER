Slide: Worked Example 2: Technical Services Transfer Pricing

Here's the thing with fact pattern.  TechServices BV (Netherlands), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EnergyMajor plc (UK), provides specialized drilling engineering services to KazakhOil (Kazakhstani production company, also owned by EnergyMajor). TechServices seconded 10 engineers to Kazakhstan for 12 months. Cost Structure (annual): Engineer salaries and benefits: USD 2,000,000 Travel and accommodation: USD 300,000 Overhead allocation from Netherlands HQ: USD 500,000 Total costs: USD 2,800,000 Proposed Charge: TechServices invoices KazakhOil USD 4,200,000 (cost plus 50%). Kazakhstan Tax Authority Position: 50% markup excessive; should be cost plus 5-10%. Question: What is the arm's length markup for technical services?

Now, analysis is interesting.  Method Selection: Cost Plus Method (CPM) appropriate for services. Service provider receives reimbursement of costs plus markup for functions performed and risks assumed. Functional Analysis: Functions: Recruitment, training, performance management of engineers; provides specialized technical expertise Assets: Human capital (specialized engineers), technical know-how Risks: Limited - costs reimbursed; no performance risk Functions: Project management, operational decisions, application of technical advice Assets: Production assets, licenses Risks: Operational risk, reservoir risk, political risk, price risk Comparability Analysis: Search for comparable companies providing technical drilling services on cost plus basis.

Comparable Companies (illustrative): Interquartile Range: 10-18% Comparability Adjustments: Risk profile: Comparables may assume greater performance risk (KazakhOil bears operational risk) Geographic market: Kazakhstan operations may command premium due to challenging environment, specialized skills Contract duration: 12-month commitment may justify higher markup vs. project-based engagements Secondment vs. standalone services: Seconded personnel fully embedded may warrant higher markup for HR management Adjusted Range: 12-20% considering Kazakhstan-specific factors. TechServices Proposed Markup: 50% Conclusion: 50% markup significantly exceeds arm's length range (12-20%). Proposed pricing likely to be challenged and adjusted by Kazakhstan tax authorities.

Arm's Length Pricing: Conservative approach (midpoint of range): 16% markup Costs: USD 2,800,000 Markup (16%): USD 448,000 Arm's length price: USD 3,248,000 Tax Impact of Adjustment: Disallowed deduction: USD 4,200,000 - USD 3,248,000 = USD 952,000 Additional taxable income: USD 952,000 Corporate tax (20%): USD 190,400 Potential penalties (25%): USD 47,600 Additional revenue recognized: USD 952,000 Corporate tax (25.8%): USD 245,616 If correlative adjustment available (Article 9(2)): May claim relief, but practical implementation varies Potential Double Taxation: USD 190,400 (Kazakhstan) + USD 245,616 (Netherlands, if no relief) = USD 436,016 Recommendations: Reprice Services: Apply 15-18% markup to align with arm's length range

- New charge: USD 2,800,000 × 1.15 to 1.18 = USD 3,220,000 - USD 3,304,000 Enhanced Documentation: This can be a bit tricky, but - Detailed functional analysis demonstrating complexity, specialization - Benchmark study with comparable technical service providers - Documentation of market conditions justifying pricing - Contract terms clearly allocating risks - Bilateral APA with Kazakhstan and Netherlands tax authorities - Prospective certainty on acceptable markup - Avoids costly disputes and double taxation Alternative Structure: - Secondment at cost: Charge costs only (no markup); KazakhOil compensates through dividend/other mechanisms - Service company approach: Dedicated service company with substantive operations, applies markup justified by functions/risks

Conclusion: Proposed 50% markup is not defensible. Reducing to 15-18% range necessary to comply with arm's length principle and avoid double taxation.

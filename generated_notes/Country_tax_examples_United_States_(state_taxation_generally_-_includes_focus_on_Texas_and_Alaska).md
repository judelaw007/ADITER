## 1. Core Framework of US State Petroleum Taxation

### 1.1 Federal vs. State Jurisdiction

The United States operates a **dual sovereignty system** where both federal and state governments possess independent taxing authority over petroleum extraction. This bifurcation creates complex compliance obligations for energy companies operating across multiple jurisdictions.

**Constitutional Basis:**
- **Tenth Amendment**: Powers not delegated to federal government are reserved to states
- **Commerce Clause**: Limits state taxation of interstate commerce
- **State ownership**: States own minerals beneath state lands and territorial waters (0-3 nautical miles)
- **Federal ownership**: Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) beyond state waters, federal lands

**Jurisdictional Division:**
- **Federal taxation**: Corporate income tax (21% under TCJA 2017), OCS royalties, federal land royalties
- **State taxation**: Severance taxes, production taxes, property taxes, state income taxes, franchise taxes
- **No preemption**: States may tax petroleum operations within their jurisdiction independently of federal taxation

### 1.2 Constitutional Limitations on State Taxation

States' taxing authority faces constitutional constraints:

**1. Commerce Clause Limitations (Complete Auto Transit Test):**
States may tax interstate commerce only if:
- Substantial nexus exists between state and taxpayer
- Tax is fairly apportioned to activities in-state
- Tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce
- Tax is fairly related to services provided by state

**2. Due Process Clause:**
Requires minimum contacts between taxpayer and taxing jurisdiction (lower threshold than Commerce Clause nexus).

**3. Supremacy Clause:**
State taxes cannot conflict with federal law or treaty obligations.

### 1.3 Major Petroleum-Producing States

**Top 5 Producing States (2024):**
1. **Texas**: 43% of US crude oil production (~5.5 million bbl/day)
2. **New Mexico**: 14% of production
3. **North Dakota**: 10% of production (Bakken formation)
4. **Alaska**: 4% of production (declining from historic highs)
5. **Oklahoma**: 4% of production

Each state maintains distinct fiscal regimes reflecting political economy, resource endowment, and revenue needs.

## 2. Technical Rules - State-Specific Taxation

### 2.1 Texas Petroleum Taxation

Texas imposes **no state corporate income tax**, relying instead on severance taxes, franchise tax, and property taxes.

#### 2.1.1 Severance Tax

**Statutory Basis:** Texas Tax Code, Title 2, Subtitle E

**Oil Severance Tax:**
- **Rate**: 4.6% of **market value** at wellhead
- **Additional**: 0.125% oil field cleanup fee (total: 4.725%)
- **Base**: Gross value at point of production (before transportation/processing)
- **Payment**: Monthly, due by 20th day of following month

**Natural Gas Severance Tax:**
- **Rate**: 7.5% of **market value** at wellhead
- **Base**: Gross value at point of production
- **High-cost gas exemption**: Rates reduced for qualifying high-cost gas wells

**Valuation Method:**
```
Market Value = Production Volume × Posted Price (or actual sales price if arm's length)

Severance Tax = Market Value × Rate
```

#### 2.1.2 Franchise Tax (Margin Tax)

**Statutory Basis:** Texas Tax Code, Chapter 171

**Structure:**
- **Rate**: 0.75% (most businesses) or 0.375% (wholesale/retail)
- **Base**: Texas gross margin (lower of: total revenue - COGS, total revenue - compensation, 70% total revenue, or 30% total revenue)
- **Threshold**: $1.23 million revenue exemption (2024)
- **Apportionment**: Texas receipts / total receipts

**Petroleum Application:**
E&P companies typically calculate margin as **total revenue minus cost of goods sold** (lifting costs, production costs).

#### 2.1.3 Property Tax

**Basis:**
- **Ad valorem property tax** on oil and gas reserves, equipment, facilities
- **County level**: Rates vary by county (typical 2-2.5%)
- **Valuation**: Market value of proven reserves (discounted cash flow method)
- **Assessment**: Annual assessment by county appraisal district

### 2.2 Alaska Petroleum Taxation

Alaska employs a sophisticated **net-based production tax** combined with corporate income tax, creating higher overall tax burden than Texas.

#### 2.2.1 Production Tax

**Statutory Basis:** Alaska Statutes Title 43.55 (Oil and Gas Production Tax)

**Structure (Post-SB 21 Reform, 2013):**
- **Base rate**: 35% of **net production value** (gross value minus qualified capital expenditures and lease expenditures)
- **Progressive component**: Additional tax for production exceeding $80/barrel (repealed 2017; flat 35% reinstated)
- **Current system (2024)**: Effectively 35% on net value with per-barrel credits (subject to legislative debate)

**Net Value Calculation:**
```
Gross Production Value = Production × ANS West Coast Price (Alaska North Slope benchmark)

Less: Qualified Capital Expenditures (QCE)
Less: Lease Expenditures (operating costs, transportation to point of sale)
Less: Tax credits (if applicable)
_________________________________________________
= Net Production Value

Production Tax = Net Value × 35% (maximum rate)
```

**Per-Barrel Credits:**
- $8 per barrel for production <50,000 bbl/day (small producer)
- $5 per barrel for new production (first 7 years)
- **Hardship provisions**: Additional relief for high-cost or marginal fields

#### 2.2.2 Corporate Income Tax

**Statutory Basis:** Alaska Statutes Title 43.20

**Structure:**
- **Rates**: Graduated from 0% to **9.4%** on taxable income >$222,000 (2024)
- **Base**: Federal taxable income with Alaska modifications
- **Apportionment**: Three-factor formula (property, payroll, sales weighted)
- **Deductibility**: Alaska production tax is **deductible** for federal purposes but **not deductible** for Alaska state income tax

#### 2.2.3 Property Tax and Royalties

**Property Tax:**
- Assessed on petroleum property at **full and true value**
- Typical rate: 20 mills (2%) of assessed value
- Unified statewide assessment (not county-level)

**State Royalties:**
- **12.5% minimum** on state lands (some leases higher: 16.67%)
- In addition to production tax and income tax
- Calculated on **gross value** at point of production

### 2.3 Other Major Producing States - Comparative Overview

| **State** | **Severance/Production Tax** | **Income Tax** | **Key Features** |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Louisiana** | 12.5% (oil); 15.975% (gas) gross | 3.5-7.5% corporate | Highest severance rate; deductible for federal |
| **North Dakota** | 5% extraction + 6.5% gross prod. tax | 1.41-4.31% corporate | **Trigger price mechanism**: Rates reduce if oil <$90/bbl |
| **Oklahoma** | 7% gross (oil and gas) | 4% corporate | **Tax holidays**: 48-month exemption for new horizontal wells |
| **Wyoming** | 6% severance (oil/gas) | 0% corporate | No corporate income tax; high property tax |
| **New Mexico** | 3.75% severance + 0.19% conservation | 5.9% corporate | Lower rates but aggressive tax enforcement |

## 3. Analytical Depth and Multi-State Issues

### 3.1 Nexus and Apportionment

**Physical Nexus:**
Production activities create **substantial nexus** triggering state tax obligations. Post-*Wayfair* (2018), economic nexus standards apply (e.g., sales thresholds).

**Apportionment Methods:**
- **Single-factor (receipts)**: Most states for E&P income
- **Three-factor (property, payroll, sales)**: Traditional method
- **Alaska specific**: Special apportionment for integrated oil companies

### 3.2 State Tax Credits and Incentives

**Texas Incentives:**
- **EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) credits**: Reduces severance tax for qualifying EOR production
- **High-cost gas exemptions**: Reduced rates for gas >$5 MMBtu lifting cost
- **Inactive well exemptions**: Severance tax exemption for low-producing wells (<10 bbl/month)

**Alaska Incentives (Subject to Recent Cuts):**
- **Small producer credit**: $8/barrel for <50,000 bbl/day operators
- **QCE (Qualified Capital Expenditure) deductions**: Capital costs deductible against production tax
- **Hardship relief**: Case-by-case relief for uneconomic fields (requires legislative approval)

### 3.3 Hardship Provisions - Alaska Focus

Alaska's production tax includes **economic limit factor (ELF)** provisions allowing reduced rates when:
- Oil prices fall below profitability thresholds
- Fields reach late-life marginal economics
- Demonstrated financial hardship (regulatory petition required)

**2023-2024 Example:** North Slope operators sought hardship relief citing high transportation costs and declining production; limited relief granted by Alaska Department of Revenue.

### 3.4 Gross vs. Net Production Taxes

**Gross Value Systems (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana):**
- **Advantages**: Simple administration, immediate revenue, recession-proof
- **Disadvantages**: Burdens marginal production, can render fields uneconomic during price downturns

**Net Value Systems (Alaska):**
- **Advantages**: Economically efficient, protects marginal fields, progressive with profitability
- **Disadvantages**: Complex audit requirements, delayed revenue, vulnerable to cost inflation

## 4. Application Methodology - Multi-State Tax Calculation Framework

**Step 1: Determine Nexus**
Identify all states where production occurs or income is apportioned.

**Step 2: Calculate State-Specific Taxes**
- Production/severance tax on gross or net value
- State corporate income tax on apportioned income
- Property tax on petroleum assets
- Franchise or privilege taxes

**Step 3: Allocate Deductions**
- Severance taxes typically deductible for federal and state income tax
- Alaska production tax deductible for federal but not Alaska state income tax

**Step 4: Apply Credits and Incentives**
Identify available credits (small producer, EOR, new production, etc.).

**Step 5: Aggregate Tax Burden**
Sum all state and federal taxes to determine effective tax rate.

## 5. Worked Example - Texas vs. Alaska Comparative Analysis

**Fact Pattern:**

PetroCompare Inc. operates identical oil production facilities:
- **Texas Facility**: Producing 10,000 bbl/day
- **Alaska Facility**: Producing 10,000 bbl/day

**Common Variables (2024):**
- Annual production: 3,650,000 barrels (both states)
- Oil price: $75/barrel (ANS West Coast for Alaska; WTI-equivalent for Texas)
- Gross revenue: $273,750,000 (each facility)
- Operating costs (lease expenditures): $100,000,000
- Capital expenditures: $50,000,000 (depreciated over 5 years = $10,000,000/year)
- Transportation costs: $5/barrel ($18,250,000)

**Tax Comparison:**

### 5.1 Texas Taxation

**Severance Tax:**
```
Market value at wellhead: $273,750,000 (gross revenue before transport)
Oil severance tax (4.6%): $273,750,000 × 4.6% = $12,592,500
Oil field cleanup fee (0.125%): $273,750,000 × 0.125% = $342,188
Total severance tax: $12,934,688
```

**Franchise Tax:**
```
Total revenue: $273,750,000
Less: COGS (operating costs): $100,000,000

| **Net After-Tax** | **$228,460,628** | **$196,094,607** | **-$32,366,021** |

*Alaska production tax reduced by small producer credit; without credit would be $36,925,000.

### 5.4 Key Insights

**1. Alaska's Higher Overall Burden:**
Despite net-based production tax (economically efficient), Alaska's **total effective rate (28.4%)** significantly exceeds Texas (16.5%) due to:
- **State royalties**: 12.5% gross (Texas has no state royalties on private land)
- **State income tax**: 9.4% (Texas has none)
- Combined effect of multiple gross-based charges (royalties, property tax) plus net-based production tax

**2. Small Producer Benefits (Alaska):**
The $8/barrel small producer credit provides substantial relief:
- Potential production tax: $36,925,000
- After credit: $7,725,000
- **Savings**: $29,200,000 (79% reduction)
- Without this credit, Alaska effective rate would be **38.9%**

**3. Capital Expenditure Treatment:**
- **Alaska**: Immediate deduction of QCE against production tax (net system incentivizes investment)
- **Texas**: No severance tax relief for capex (gross system penalizes capital-intensive projects)

**4. Federal Tax Interaction:**
- Texas: Higher state taxes generate larger federal deductions → lower federal tax
- Alaska: State royalties (gross) and production tax deductible for federal purposes reduce federal liability by $8.6 million relative to Texas

**5. Economic Impact on Investment:**
For marginal projects, Alaska's net-based system protects against price downturns (losses reduce production tax). Texas's gross system maintains severance tax liability regardless of profitability, potentially forcing premature abandonment.

## 6. Recent Developments (2023-2025)

### 6.1 Alaska Tax Reform Debates

**SB 114 (2023) - Failed Proposal:**
- Attempted to increase production tax minimum from 4% to 10% of gross value
- Would have eliminated small producer credits
- Rejected by voters in referendum (November 2023)
- **Impact**: Preserved current favorable treatment for small producers

**HB 50 (2024) - Hardship Relief Extensions:**
- Extended hardship provisions for North Slope legacy fields
- Allows case-by-case production tax reductions for fields demonstrating economic hardship
- Approved April 2024; applies through 2027

**Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend Debate:**
Ongoing political tension between maximizing petroleum revenues (higher taxes) and attracting investment (lower taxes/incentives). 2024-2025 legislative sessions focused on balancing budget needs with declining production trends.

### 6.2 Texas Franchise Tax Adjustments

**HB 2 (2023) - Revenue Threshold Increase:**
- Raised no-tax-due threshold from $1.18 million to **$2.47 million** (effective 2024)
- Reduces compliance burden for smaller operators
- Estimated revenue impact: $1 billion reduction over biennium

**Property Tax Relief Initiatives (2023):**
- $18 billion property tax relief package (statewide, not petroleum-specific)
- School district compression of property tax rates
- Marginal impact on petroleum property tax burden (primarily benefits homeowners)

### 6.3 North Dakota Trigger Price Mechanism (2024 Update)

**HB 1158 (2024):**
- Modified trigger price for reduced severance tax from $90/barrel to **$70/barrel**
- When oil prices <$70/barrel, extraction tax reduces from 5% to **2%**
- Responsive to industry concerns about sustained lower prices
- **Effective**: July 2024

### 6.4 Federal Developments Impacting State Taxation

**Inflation Reduction Act (2022) - Section 45Q Carbon Capture Credits:**
- Enhanced federal tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration
- Indirect state impact: Reduces federal taxable income, slightly increasing relative state tax burden
- Texas and North Dakota operators actively pursuing CCS projects

**Pillar Two (OECD Global Minimum Tax) - Limited State Impact:**
- Extractive industries partially excluded from Pillar One
- State taxes (including severance taxes) may count as "covered taxes" toward 15% minimum
- US implementation uncertain; unlikely to directly affect state taxation through 2025

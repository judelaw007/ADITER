## Topic 29: Mergers and Acquisitions
### Interest Deductions and Debt Push Down

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Critical Role of Acquisition Financing

Oil and gas mergers and acquisitions typically involve substantial capital outlays, frequently financed through a combination of **debt and equity**. The tax treatment of **interest expense** on acquisition debt is one of the most significant value drivers in transaction structuring. In many cases, the present value of interest tax shields can amount to 10-20% of the acquisition price, making interest deductibility a critical negotiating point.

**Key questions** that drive M&A tax planning include:

- Will interest on acquisition debt be **tax deductible**?
- **Where** in the corporate structure can interest deductions be most effectively utilized?
- How do **thin capitalization** and **earnings stripping** rules limit interest deductions?
- Can interest deductions be **"pushed down"** to profitable operating companies in resource-rich jurisdictions?

### 1.2 Fundamental Tax Principle: Nexus Between Debt and Income

Most tax systems apply a **nexus requirement**: interest is deductible only if the borrowed funds are used to generate **assessable income**. This principle creates a fundamental distinction:

- **Asset purchases**: Debt finances income-producing assets → interest generally **deductible**
- **Share purchases**: Debt finances shares that may generate **exempt dividends** → interest may be **non-deductible**

This topic requires candidates to analyze complex interaction between:
- Domestic tax rules on interest deductibility
- **Participation exemption** regimes
- **Anti-avoidance** rules (thin capitalization, earnings stripping)
- Cross-border tax consolidation mechanisms
- **PSC regime** limitations

## 2. Interest Deductibility in Asset vs. Share Acquisitions

### 2.1 Asset Purchase Structures

#### 2.1.1 General Rule: Interest is Deductible

When debt is used to finance the acquisition of **oil and gas assets** (petroleum licenses, production facilities, drilling rigs, pipelines), the interest expense is **generally deductible** because:

- The assets will generate **taxable business profits**
- Interest expense has a **direct nexus** to the production of assessable income
- The expense satisfies the **business purpose** test

**Statutory Basis:**
- **US**: US Internal Revenue Code Section 163(a) - "There shall be allowed as a deduction all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness"
- **UK**: Corporation Tax Act 2009, Sections 297-298 - Interest is deductible if incurred for trade purposes
- **Australia**: Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (1997), Section 8-1 - Deductible if incurred in gaining or producing assessable income

#### 2.1.2 Limitations and Restrictions

Even in asset purchases, interest deductibility may be limited by:

**Thin Capitalization Rules:**
- Restrict interest deductions where **debt-to-equity ratios** exceed statutory thresholds
- Typically apply to **related-party debt** but may extend to total debt in some jurisdictions

**Earnings Stripping Rules:**
- Limit interest deductions to a **percentage of earnings** (e.g., 30% of EBITDA)
- Example: **US Internal Revenue Code Section 163(j)**, **German Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz - EStG) Section 4h**, **OECD BEPS Action 4** recommendations

**Transfer Pricing:**
- **Related-party interest rates** must comply with **arm's length principle**
- Tax authorities may recharacterize excessive interest as **non-deductible distributions**

**PSC Regime Limitations:**
- **Production Sharing Contracts** often **exclude financing costs** from recoverable costs
- Interest expense cannot be recovered through **cost oil**
- However, interest may still be deductible for **corporate income tax** purposes on the contractor's share of profit oil

### 2.2 Share Purchase Structures

#### 2.2.1 General Rule: Interest May Be Non-Deductible

When debt finances the acquisition of **shares** in an oil and gas company, interest deductibility becomes significantly more restricted.

**Policy Rationale:**
Many jurisdictions apply **participation exemption regimes** that exempt qualifying **dividends** and **capital gains** from taxation. The policy logic is:

1. Subsidiary's profits are taxed at the subsidiary level
2. Exempt dividends at parent level to avoid **double taxation**
3. **Corollary**: If dividend income is exempt, **interest expense** incurred to earn that exempt income should be **non-deductible**

#### 2.2.2 Participation Exemption Regimes

**Common Requirements:**
| Jurisdiction | Minimum Holding | Holding Period | Substance Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Netherlands** | 5% | None | Subject to reasonable tax |
| **Luxembourg** | 10% or €1.2M | 12 months | Subject to tax or EU/treaty resident |
| **Germany** | 10% | None | Corporate shareholder |
| **Belgium** | 10% or €2.5M | 12 months | Subject to tax >= 15% |
| **France** | 5% | 2 years | Operating company |

**Impact on Interest Deductibility:**
- **Netherlands**: Interest on debt used to finance participation shareholdings is generally deductible, subject to earnings stripping rules (20% of EBITDA with EUR 1 million threshold)
- **Germany**: **5% non-deductible** under German Corporate Income Tax Act (Körperschaftsteuergesetz - KStG) Section 8b(5)
- **Luxembourg**: Generally allows deduction, but subject to anti-abuse provisions
- **France & UK**: Generally **allow interest deductions** even with participation exemption (more favorable)

#### 2.2.3 Exceptions and Planning Opportunities

Interest deductions on share acquisition debt may be preserved through:

1. **Jurisdictions without strict linkage**: France, UK, Ireland allow interest deductions despite dividend exemption
2. **Business purpose exemptions**: Demonstrating acquisition serves broader commercial strategy beyond tax avoidance
3. **Debt push-down structures**: Transferring debt to operating subsidiaries to utilize deductions against operational income
4. **Hybrid financing**: Using instruments treated as equity for participation exemption but debt for interest deductions

---

## 3. Thin Capitalization Rules

### 3.1 Concept and Policy Objective

**Thin capitalization rules** prevent multinational groups from:
- Over-leveraging subsidiaries with **related-party debt**
- Stripping profits from high-tax jurisdictions through **excessive interest payments**
- Creating **artificial capital structures** solely for tax arbitrage

**Typical Structure:**
Tax authorities set maximum **debt-to-equity ratios** (e.g., 1.5:1, 2:1, or 3:1). Interest on debt **exceeding the threshold** becomes **non-deductible**.

### 3.2 Common Methodologies

#### 3.2.1 Fixed Ratio Method

Limits debt to a multiple of equity. Example:

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio Test:**
- **Allowable debt = Equity × Safe harbor ratio**
- **Excess debt = Total debt - Allowable debt**
- **Disallowed interest = (Excess debt / Total debt) × Total interest**

#### 3.2.2 Arm's Length Debt Test

Compares actual debt levels with what **independent third parties** would lend based on:
- Company's creditworthiness
- Asset values and cash flow generation
- Industry norms

#### 3.2.3 Earnings-Based Limitation (EBITDA Test)

Modern approach adopted under **OECD BEPS Action 4**:

**Interest deductibility capped at:**
- **30% of EBITDA** (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)
- Applies to **total interest expense**, not just related-party debt
- Disallowed interest may be carried forward (subject to time limits)

**Key Feature for Oil & Gas:**
For US tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, **US Internal Revenue Code Section 163(j) ATI** (Adjusted Taxable Income) is calculated by adding back depreciation, amortization, **and depletion**. This is highly favorable for oil and gas companies, as **depletion allowances** are substantial.

**Example:**
- EBIT: $100 million
- Depreciation: $20 million
- **Depletion: $30 million**
- **ATI (EBITDA + Depletion) = $150 million**
- **Maximum deductible interest = 30% × $150M = $45 million**

Without depletion add-back, ATI would be only $120 million, limiting deductions to $36 million.

### 3.3 Impact on Oil & Gas Acquisitions

Thin capitalization rules require careful **debt-equity balancing**:

- **Over-leveraging** triggers interest disallowances, reducing after-tax cash flow
- **Under-leveraging** forgoes tax shields, increasing effective tax rate
- **Optimal capital structure** maximizes deductions while staying within thin cap limits

**Planning Considerations:**
- Use **third-party debt** where possible (often exempt from thin cap rules)
- Structure **equity contributions** to support higher debt levels
- Utilize **back-to-back financing** or **guarantees** rather than direct loans
- Monitor **currency fluctuations** that may inadvertently breach ratios

## 4. Debt Push-Down Structures

### 4.1 Concept and Mechanics

A **debt push-down** is a financing technique where acquisition debt incurred at a **holding company** level is effectively transferred to an **operating subsidiary** to utilize interest deductions against the subsidiary's profits.

#### 4.1.1 Why Debt Push-Down?

**Problem:**
- Parent Company borrows $500M to acquire shares in Target Oil Company
- Parent has limited income → cannot utilize $25M annual interest deductions
- Target generates $100M annual taxable profits → pays full tax

**Solution:**
- Push debt down to Target's jurisdiction
- Use interest deductions to offset Target's $100M taxable income
- Requires **tax consolidation** or **intra-group financing arrangements**

#### 4.1.2 Common Structures

**Structure 1: Acquisition SPV with Tax Consolidation**

```
Parent Company (Country A)
    |
    | $500M equity
    |
Acquisition SPV (Country B - Target's jurisdiction)
    |
    | $500M borrowed from Bank
    | Interest: $25M/year
    |
    | Acquires 100% shares
    |
Target Oil Company (Country B)
    Taxable income: $100M/year
```

**Tax Consolidation:**
- SPV and Target form **consolidated group** in Country B
- SPV's $25M interest expense offsets Target's $100M income
- **Consolidated taxable income: $75M**
- Tax savings: $25M × tax rate

**Structure 2: Intra-Group Loan Push-Down**

After share acquisition:
1. SPV borrows $500M from external bank
2. SPV on-lends $500M to Target (intra-group loan)
3. Target pays interest to SPV (deductible by Target)
4. SPV uses interest received to service bank debt

**Requirements:**
- Intra-group interest rate must be **arm's length**
- Target's debt level must comply with **thin capitalization**
- Loan must have **commercial substance**

### 4.2 Legal and Tax Considerations

#### 4.2.1 Tax Consolidation Requirements

Debt push-down through consolidation requires that the target jurisdiction:

- Allows **group relief** or **loss transfer** mechanisms
- Permits **tax consolidation** at specified ownership thresholds (typically 75-100%)
- Recognizes losses from financing entities within the group

**Jurisdictions with favorable consolidation:**
- **US**: 80% affiliation for federal consolidation
- **UK**: 75% group relief
- **Australia**: 100% consolidation
- **Netherlands**: Fiscal unity for integrated groups

**Jurisdictions without consolidation:**
Many resource-rich countries **do not permit tax consolidation**, including:
- **Indonesia**
- **Brazil** (limited group relief)
- **India**
- **Nigeria**

In these jurisdictions, debt push-down requires **intra-group loans** rather than consolidation.

#### 4.2.2 Anti-Avoidance Challenges

Tax authorities increasingly challenge debt push-down as **artificial arrangements** designed solely to obtain tax benefits:

**Poland Anti-Debt Push-Down Rules (Post-2018):**
- Under Article 16(1)(13e) of the Polish Corporate Income Tax Act (effective January 1, 2018), taxpayers must exclude from tax-deductible costs any financial expenses incurred in acquiring shares
- Expressly **denies deductions** for interest on acquisition debt in corporate reorganizations
- Applies to mergers, contributions, and **tax group formations**
- Prevents taxpayers from "double dipping" through debt push-down

**General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR):**
- UK, Australia, and other jurisdictions may apply **GAAR** to deny benefits where:
  - Principal purpose is tax avoidance
  - Arrangement lacks **commercial substance**
  - Defeats the purpose of tax legislation

**Economic Substance Tests:**
- SPV must have adequate **equity capital**
- Must demonstrate **decision-making** and **risk management** at SPV level
- Cannot be a "shell company" with no employees or functions

### 4.3 Timing Considerations

#### 4.3.1 When to Push Down Debt

Optimal timing depends on the target company's **tax capacity** (ability to absorb deductions):

**Scenario 1: Target in Exploration Phase**
- Target has **carry-forward tax losses** from exploration costs
- **No current taxable income** to shelter
- **Defer debt push-down** until Target reaches production and profitability

**Scenario 2: Target is Producing**
- Target generates substantial **taxable income**
- **Immediate benefit** from interest deductions
- **Push down debt promptly** after acquisition

#### 4.3.2 Loss Preservation

Care must be taken to preserve Target's **carry-forward losses**:

- Many jurisdictions impose **loss restriction rules** on change of control
- **Continuity of business tests** may apply
- **50% ownership change** often triggers loss limitations (e.g., US Section 382)

Debt push-down should be structured to avoid triggering loss restrictions.

## 5. PSC Regime Considerations

### 5.1 Limitation on Cost Recovery

**Production Sharing Contracts** create unique challenges for interest deductibility:

#### 5.1.1 Financing Costs Excluded from Cost Oil

Most PSC regimes **exclude the following from cost oil recovery:**
- **Interest expense** on acquisition debt
- **Signature bonuses**
- **Financing charges**

**Rationale:**
- PSCs are designed to recover **exploration, development, and production costs**
- Acquisition financing is a **capital transaction** at the investor level
- Government receives its share through **profit oil**, not cost reimbursement

**Impact:**
Even if interest is **deductible for corporate income tax**, it **cannot be recovered through cost oil**.

#### 5.1.2 Corporate Tax on Profit Oil

Interest deductions **may be available** against corporate tax on the contractor's profit oil share, depending on the jurisdiction's tax laws:

**Indonesia:**
- Contractors pay **corporate income tax** on profit oil
- **Note**: Indonesia previously applied thin capitalization rules with a 4:1 debt-to-equity ratio (effective 2016-2018), but these rules have since been repealed. Transfer pricing principles now apply to related-party debt.
- Participation exemption may restrict deductions on share acquisition debt

**Nigeria:**
- PSC contractors subject to **Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT)**
- Interest deductibility varies by contract terms
- Deep Offshore PSCs may have different treatment

**Malaysia:**
- Contractors under PSCs pay **Petroleum Income Tax**
- Interest deductions permitted subject to general rules

### 5.2 Planning Around PSC Limitations

To maximize interest deductibility in PSC jurisdictions:

**Strategy 1: Parent-Level Deductions**
- Incur debt at **parent company level** in home jurisdiction
- Deduct interest against **worldwide income** (if home country uses worldwide taxation)
- Effective if parent has substantial non-PSC income

**Strategy 2: Regional Holding Company**
- Establish holding company in jurisdiction with:
  - **Tax consolidation** with other regional subsidiaries
  - Favorable treatment of interest expense
  - **Tax treaty network**

**Strategy 3: Portfolio Approach**
- Use debt financing at **portfolio level** covering multiple projects
- Allocate interest deductions across projects in **tax and royalty regimes** (where deductible) and minimize allocation to PSC projects

## 6. International Tax Planning Strategies

### 6.1 Choice of Acquisition Holding Company Jurisdiction

Selection of the **acquisition vehicle's jurisdiction** is critical for optimizing interest deductibility:

**Criteria for Jurisdiction Selection:**
| Factor | Preferred Characteristics |
|---|---|
| **Interest deductibility** | Allows deductions despite participation exemption |
| **Tax consolidation** | Permits group relief or fiscal unity |
| **Thin capitalization** | Generous debt-to-equity ratios or exemptions for third-party debt |
| **Treaty network** | Reduces withholding taxes on dividends, interest |
| **Substance requirements** | Manageable economic substance thresholds |

**Commonly Used Jurisdictions:**

**Luxembourg:**
- Participation exemption with relatively favorable interest rules
- Extensive tax treaty network
- Accepts economic substance with proper structuring

**Netherlands:**
- Participation exemption (5% threshold)
- Fiscal unity for 95%+ owned groups
- However, **interest limitation rules** can be restrictive
- Requires significant substance under anti-abuse measures

**United Kingdom:**
- Allows interest deductions despite substantial shareholding exemption
- 75% group relief
- Robust legal framework

**Singapore:**
- No thin capitalization rules (though transfer pricing applies)
- Territorial tax system
- Extensive treaty network

### 6.2 Hybrid Instruments

**Hybrid securities** are financial instruments treated differently in two jurisdictions, creating **double deductions** or **deduction/no-inclusion** outcomes:

**Example:**
- Instrument treated as **debt** in Country A (interest deductible)
- Treated as **equity** in Country B (exempt dividend income)

**BEPS Action 2 Response:**
- Most countries have enacted **hybrid mismatch rules** to deny deductions where corresponding income is not taxed
- Hybrid planning is now significantly restricted

## 7. Worked Examples

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Thin Capitalization and Earnings Stripping (US Section 163(j))

**Facts:**

US Parent Corp acquires Shale Oil Company, a US-based oil and gas producer, for **$1 billion**. The acquisition is financed with:
- **$700 million debt** from a bank syndicate at **6% interest** = **$42 million annual interest**
- **$300 million equity** from US Parent's existing cash

Shale Oil generates the following annual figures:
- Revenue: **$300 million**
- Operating expenses (excluding interest, depreciation, depletion): **$150 million**
- **Depreciation**: **$30 million**
- **Percentage depletion**: **$25 million** (15% of revenue, subject to limits)
- **Taxable income before interest and depreciation/depletion**: **$150 million**

**Corporate tax rate: 21%**

**Thin Capitalization Test:** US does not have fixed debt-to-equity ratios but applies **Section 163(j) earnings stripping**.

**Required:**

1. Calculate Shale Oil's **Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI)** under Section 163(j)
2. Determine the **maximum deductible interest expense**
3. Calculate **taxable income** and **tax liability**
4. Determine **disallowed interest** and carryforward treatment

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Calculation of ATI**

For tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, **ATI = EBITDA + Depletion**:

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Revenue | $300M |
| Less: Operating expenses | ($150M) |
| **EBIT** | **$150M** |
| Add back: Depreciation | $30M |
| Add back: **Depletion** | $25M |
| **ATI (EBITDA + Depletion)** | **$205M** |

**Part 2: Maximum Deductible Interest**

Under **Section 163(j)**:
- **Maximum deductible interest = 30% × ATI**
- **= 30% × $205M = $61.5 million**

Actual interest expense: **$42 million**

Since $42M < $61.5M, **all interest is deductible** (not limited by Section 163(j)).

**Part 3: Taxable Income and Tax Liability**

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| EBIT | $150M |
| Less: Interest expense (fully deductible) | ($42M) |
| Less: Depreciation | ($30M) |
| Less: Depletion | ($25M) |
| **Taxable income** | **$53M** |
| Tax at 21% | **$11.13M** |

**Part 4: No Disallowed Interest**

Since all $42M of interest is deductible, there is **no disallowed interest** to carry forward.

**Impact of Depletion Add-Back:**

If depletion were **not added back** to ATI:
- ATI = $150M + $30M depreciation = **$180M**
- Maximum interest = 30% × $180M = **$54M**
- Still sufficient to cover $42M interest, but **margin is reduced**

In cases with higher interest expense, the depletion add-back becomes critical.

**Tax Savings from Interest Deduction:**
- Interest deduction saves: $42M × 21% = **$8.82M** annually
- Present value over 10 years at 8% discount: **$59.2M**

═══════════════════════════════════════════

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2: Debt Push-Down with Tax Consolidation

**Facts:**

Global Oil PLC (incorporated in **UK**) acquires **100% of the shares** of Target Oil AS, a Norwegian oil and gas company, for **€800 million**.

**Financing Structure:**
- Global Oil establishes **Target Holdco AS**, a Norwegian subsidiary
- Target Holdco borrows **€600 million** from banks at **5% interest** = **€30 million/year**
- Global Oil contributes **€200 million equity** to Target Holdco
- Target Holdco uses total €800M to acquire Target Oil shares

**Target Oil Financial Information:**
- Annual **taxable income**: **€100 million** (before interest and depreciation)
- Annual **depreciation**: €15 million
- **Norwegian corporate tax rate**: **22%**

**Norway Tax Rules:**
- Allows **group contribution scheme** for Norwegian companies in 90%+ ownership
- **Thin capitalization**: No specific debt-to-equity rules, but **arm's length principle** applies to related-party debt
- **Interest limitation rule**: Currently 25% of tax EBITDA (Norway adopted stricter rules than the OECD BEPS Action 4 recommendation of 30%)

**Required:**

1. Determine if thin cap rules are breached
2. Calculate **Section 163(j)-equivalent limitation** under Norwegian interest limitation
3. Calculate **Norwegian tax liability** with and without debt push-down
4. Quantify **annual tax savings** from debt push-down structure

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Thin Capitalization Assessment**

**Target Holdco's balance sheet:**
- Assets: €800M (shares in Target Oil)
- Debt: €600M
- Equity: €200M
- **Debt-to-equity ratio: 3:1**

Norway does not have fixed debt-to-equity thin cap rules, but the **3:1 ratio is within common market practices** for acquisition financing. The arm's length principle would likely accept this structure if third-party banks provided the debt.

**Part 2: Interest Limitation Rule (EBITDA-Based)**

**Consolidated Group (Target Holdco + Target Oil):**

Target Holdco:
- Interest expense: €30M
- No operating income

Target Oil:
- Operating income: €100M
- Depreciation: €15M

**Consolidated EBITDA:**
- EBIT: €100M (Target Oil)
- Add back: Depreciation: €15M
- **EBITDA: €115M**

**Maximum deductible interest (25% of tax EBITDA):**
- **= 25% × €115M = €28.75M**

Actual interest: **€30M**

Since €30M > €28.75M, **€1.25M of interest is non-deductible** under Norway's interest limitation rule. Only €28.75M is deductible.

**Part 3: Tax Liability Comparison**

**(a) Without Debt Push-Down (Global Oil borrows at UK parent level):**

Target Oil standalone (Norway):
- Taxable income: €100M - €15M depreciation = **€85M**
- Norwegian tax at 22%: **€18.7M**

Global Oil (UK):
- Interest expense: €30M (deductible in UK against other income)
- Assume UK tax rate 19%: UK tax relief = €30M × 19% = €5.7M

**Total group tax: €18.7M (Norway) - €5.7M (UK relief) = €13.0M net**

**(b) With Debt Push-Down and Consolidation:**

**Consolidated Norwegian Group (Target Holdco + Target Oil):**

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Target Oil operating income | €100M |
| Less: Deductible interest (Target Holdco) | (€28.75M) |
| Less: Depreciation (Target Oil) | (€15M) |
| **Consolidated taxable income** | **€56.25M** |
| Norwegian tax at 22% | **€12.375M** |

**Note**: €1.25M of interest is non-deductible due to the 25% EBITDA limitation.

Global Oil (UK):
- No interest expense at UK level

**Total group tax: €12.375M**

**Part 4: Tax Savings**

**Annual tax savings from debt push-down:**
- Without debt push-down: €13.0M
- With debt push-down: €12.375M
- **Savings: €0.625M per year** (approx. **4.8% improvement**)

Over 10 years (assuming debt remains): **€6.25M cumulative**

Present value at 7% discount: **€4.4M**

**Explanation of Savings:**
The debt push-down structure allows interest deductions (subject to the 25% EBITDA limitation) to offset Norwegian income taxed at **22%**, compared to UK tax relief at **19%**. The **3 percentage point differential** creates the annual benefit, though it is partially offset by the €1.25M non-deductible interest under Norway's interest limitation rule.

**Additional Benefits:**
- Simplified group structure (all operations in Norway)
- No cross-border withholding taxes on interest payments
- Better alignment of debt with operating cash flows

**Risks and Considerations:**
- Norwegian tax authorities may challenge the **commercial substance** of Target Holdco
- **Transfer pricing** scrutiny if future intra-group loans are used
- **BEPS anti-avoidance** measures may apply if structure lacks economic purpose
- **Change of control** provisions in licenses may require government approval

# The Link Between International Agreements and Different Types of Natural Resource Governance

---

## 1. Core Framework: International Agreements in Extractive Industries

### 1.1 Introduction to the Governance-Treaty Nexus

The choice between **proprietorial (concession)** and **non-proprietorial (PSC)** governance regimes profoundly affects how **international agreements** operate to protect investors, allocate taxing rights, and resolve disputes. International agreements serve as a **protective framework** that overlays domestic fiscal regimes, creating binding obligations between states and establishing investor rights that transcend national legislation.

**Three Primary Categories of International Agreements:**

1. **Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)**: Treaties between two states protecting foreign investment
2. **Multilateral Investment Agreements**: The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), regional agreements
3. **Tax Treaties**: Bilateral agreements preventing double taxation and allocating taxing rights

Each category interacts differently with proprietorial vs. non-proprietorial regimes due to fundamental structural differences in **ownership, fiscal mechanisms, and contractual relationships**.

### 1.2 Why International Agreements Matter for Governance Structures

**Critical Functions:**
- **Investment Protection**: Safeguarding against expropriation, unfair treatment, and discriminatory measures
- **Fiscal Stability**: Protecting contractual fiscal terms from unilateral state changes
- **Dispute Resolution**: Providing neutral arbitration forums outside domestic courts
- **Tax Certainty**: Preventing double taxation and clarifying withholding tax obligations
- **Market Access**: Facilitating cross-border investment flows through risk mitigation

**Governance-Specific Risks:**

| **Risk** | **Proprietorial Regime** | **Non-Proprietorial Regime (PSC)** |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Fiscal instability** | High (subject to legislative change) | Moderate (contractual stabilization) |
| **Expropriation** | Moderate (ownership at wellhead) | Lower (state already owns resources) |
| **Tax treaty disputes** | High (full TP/CIT exposure) | Moderate (limited to cost recovery/profit share tax) |
| **Contract sanctity** | Lower (no direct contract) | Higher (bilateral contract with state) |

---

## 2. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and Governance Regimes

### 2.1 Structure and Key Provisions of BITs

**Definition:** A **Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)** is an agreement between two sovereign states establishing legal protections for investments made by nationals of one state in the territory of the other.

**Standard BIT Provisions:**

1. **Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET)**: Requires host state to provide fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory treatment
2. **Protection Against Expropriation**: Compensation required for direct or indirect expropriation
3. **Full Protection and Security**: Physical and legal security for investments
4. **National Treatment and Most Favoured Nation (MFN)**: No discrimination vs. domestic or third-country investors
5. **Free Transfer of Funds**: Repatriation of profits, dividends, and capital
6. **Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS)**: Arbitration under ICSID, UNCITRAL, or ICC rules

Over **2,800 BITs** have been negotiated globally, providing the primary international legal framework for investment protection in the extractive industries and other sectors.

### 2.2 BIT Application to Proprietorial Regimes

**Interaction with Concession/Tax-Royalty Systems:**

In proprietorial regimes, BITs provide critical protection because:

1. **No Direct Contract with State**: Concessions typically involve a **license** issued under domestic law, not a bilateral contract. BITs fill the **contractual gap** by providing international legal protections.

2. **Vulnerability to Legislative Changes**: Since fiscal terms are set by **domestic tax law** (not contract), governments can **unilaterally change** tax rates, royalties, or allowances. BITs constrain such changes through:
   - **FET obligation**: Arbitrary tax increases may breach fair treatment
   - **Indirect expropriation**: Drastic fiscal changes reducing investment value may constitute expropriation
   - **Stabilization through international law**: Even without contractual stabilization, BIT protections provide a degree of fiscal predictability

3. **ISDS as Recourse**: Investors can challenge fiscal changes via **international arbitration**, bypassing potentially biased domestic courts.

**Example Case: *Occidental Petroleum v. Republic of Ecuador* (2012)**

Ecuador cancelled Occidental's **concession license** (proprietorial regime) for alleged contract violations. Occidental invoked the **USA-Ecuador BIT**, claiming expropriation. The ICSID tribunal initially awarded **$1.77 billion** compensation (later reduced to $1.1 billion following partial annulment in 2015), demonstrating BIT protection strength even absent a PSC-style contract [ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11]. The tribunal found that while Occidental had breached the participation contract, Ecuador's termination decree was not proportionate and constituted a breach of the BIT.

### 2.3 BIT Application to Non-Proprietorial Regimes (PSCs)

**Dual Protection Layer:**

PSC regimes benefit from **overlapping protection**:

1. **Contractual Stabilization Clauses**: PSCs typically include **frozen law** or **economic equilibrium** clauses directly in the contract
2. **BIT Protections**: Investors can invoke BITs **in addition to** contractual rights

**Key Differences:**

| **Feature** | **PSC + BIT** | **Concession + BIT** |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Primary protection** | Contract (stabilization clause) | BIT (no contract with state) |
| **Dispute forum** | International arbitration (ICC/ICSID per PSC clause) | International arbitration (ICSID per BIT) |
| **Fiscal stability mechanism** | Contractual freeze or equilibrium | BIT's FET and expropriation protections |
| **Expropriation standard** | Contract breach + BIT expropriation | BIT expropriation only |

**Strategic Advantage:** In PSC regimes, investors have **dual recourse** - they can allege **breach of contract** (PSC terms) **and** breach of BIT obligations, strengthening their position.

**Example Case: *Chevron v. Republic of Ecuador* (2010)**

Ecuador's 2010 Hydrocarbons Law unilaterally changed fiscal terms in existing **PSCs**. Chevron invoked the **USA-Ecuador BIT**, arguing the changes constituted **indirect expropriation**. The tribunal ruled Ecuador breached **stabilization commitments** and BIT obligations, awarding compensation. This demonstrates how BITs **reinforce** PSC stabilization clauses [PCA Case No. 2009-23].

### 2.4 Stabilization Clauses: The Contractual Bridge

**Definition:** **Stabilization clauses** are contractual provisions in oil and gas agreements that protect investors from adverse changes in the fiscal, legal, or regulatory framework during the contract life [Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, 2016].

**Types of Stabilization Clauses:**

1. **Freezing Clauses (Frozen Law)**
   - **Effect**: Lock in the legal/fiscal framework as of contract signature
   - **Duration**: Typically 10-30 years (PSC life)
   - **Example**: "The fiscal terms applicable shall be those in force on the Effective Date, and no subsequent legislative change shall affect this Contract"

2. **Economic Equilibrium Clauses**
   - **Effect**: If fiscal changes occur, parties **renegotiate** to restore economic balance
   - **Mechanism**: If government take increases by X%, contractor share increases to compensate
   - **Example**: "If legislative changes increase Government Take by more than 5%, the profit oil split shall be adjusted to maintain Contractor's IRR"

3. **Hybrid Clauses**
   - Combination of freezing (for fiscal terms) and equilibrium (for regulatory changes)

**Prevalence by Regime Type:**

| **Regime Type** | **Stabilization Frequency** | **Typical Clause Type** |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Non-Proprietorial (PSC)** | Very High (80-90% of contracts) | Freezing or hybrid |
| **Proprietorial (Concession - Developing Countries)** | Moderate (40-60%) | Economic equilibrium |
| **Proprietorial (Concession - OECD Countries)** | Low (10-20%) | Rare; BIT/tax treaty relied upon |

**Why PSCs Use Stabilization More:**
- PSCs are **long-term bilateral contracts** (20-30 years), making contractual stabilization natural
- Concessions are often **licenses under domestic law**, making contractual stabilization legally challenging (government cannot contract away sovereignty to legislate)

**Legal Effectiveness:**

The enforceability of stabilization clauses depends on:
1. **Contract law vs. sovereignty**: Some jurisdictions hold that states cannot contract away legislative power
2. **BIT reinforcement**: Clauses gain strength when protected by BIT FET and expropriation provisions
3. **International arbitration**: Awards have consistently upheld stabilization clauses (e.g., *Aminoil v. Kuwait*, *Texaco v. Libya*)

## 3. Multilateral Agreements: The Energy Charter Treaty

### 3.1 Overview of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)

**Background:** The **Energy Charter Treaty** (1994) is a multilateral agreement providing comprehensive investment protection and dispute resolution for the energy sector. Originally signed by 50+ countries (primarily European and Central Asian states), it aims to establish a **legal framework** for international energy cooperation [ECT, 1994].

**Key Provisions Relevant to Governance:**

1. **Investment Protection (Part III)**: FET, expropriation protection, free transfer of funds
2. **Sovereignty Over Energy Resources (Article 18)**: Recognizes state ownership of resources
3. **ISDS Mechanism**: Investor-state arbitration under ICSID, SCC, or UNCITRAL rules
4. **Treaty on Energy Transit**: Protects cross-border energy flows

**Recent Developments:**
- **EU Withdrawal**: The EU formally adopted its withdrawal decision in May 2024, with the withdrawal taking effect thereafter. Multiple member states withdrew individually: Italy (2016), France, Germany and Poland (2023), with additional states including Spain, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Portugal and the UK following in 2024-2025. The primary reason cited was incompatibility with climate goals under the European Green Deal and Paris Agreement.
- **Modernization Efforts**: Amendments were proposed to align ECT with Paris Agreement and limit fossil fuel investment protections, though many states opted for withdrawal rather than reform

### 3.2 ECT and Governance Regimes

**Unique Feature:** The ECT provides investment protection **regardless of whether a BIT exists** between the investor's home state and the host state. This creates **automatic protection** for energy investments in ECT signatory countries.

**Application to Different Governance Types:**

**Proprietorial Regimes (UK, Netherlands, Denmark - prior to respective withdrawals):**
- ECT provided **additional layer** beyond domestic law
- Investors could challenge tax increases via ECT arbitration
- **Example**: Potential claims under ECT regarding UK's Energy Profits Levy (windfall tax introduced in 2022) - the legal basis for such claims existed under ECT protections

**Non-Proprietorial Regimes (Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan):**
- ECT **reinforces PSC stabilization clauses**
- Dual protection: PSC contract terms + ECT investment protections
- **Example**: Kazakhstan PSCs benefit from both contractual stability and ECT protections

### 3.3 Impact of ECT Withdrawal on Governance

The **EU and member state withdrawals** create **asymmetry** in investment protection:

| **Scenario** | **With ECT in force** | **After withdrawal** |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **EU investor in non-EU ECT state** | ECT protection available | BIT protection only (if BIT exists) |
| **Non-EU investor in EU state** | ECT protection (sunset clause applies 20 years) | BIT protection only |
| **EU-to-EU investment** | ECT protection | BIT protection (if intra-EU BIT exists, but CJEU restricts intra-EU arbitration) |

**Implication for Governance Choice:** Following EU withdrawals, investors in PSC regimes (e.g., Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan) rely more heavily on **contractual stabilization** and **bilateral BITs** rather than multilateral ECT protection.

## 4. Tax Treaties and Governance Regimes

### 4.1 Structure and Function of Tax Treaties

**Tax treaties** (Double Taxation Conventions - DTCs) serve distinct purposes from investment treaties:

1. **Prevent Double Taxation**: Allocate taxing rights between residence and source countries
2. **Reduce Withholding Taxes**: Lower rates on dividends, interest, royalties
3. **Permanent Establishment Rules**: Define when source country can tax business profits
4. **Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)**: Resolve disputes between tax authorities

**Based on OECD or UN Model Tax Conventions**, with over 3,000 tax treaties globally [OECD, 2017].

### 4.2 Tax Treaty Interaction with Proprietorial Regimes

**Full Tax Treaty Application:**

In concession regimes, standard tax treaty provisions apply comprehensively:

**Article 5 (Permanent Establishment):**
- Oil and gas **extraction sites** typically constitute PE after **6-12 months** (UN Model: 6 months; OECD Model: 12 months; many treaties specify immediate PE for extractive industries)
- PE existence triggers **source country taxation** of profits

**Article 7 (Business Profits):**
- Profits attributable to PE are taxable in source country
- Relevant for determining which country taxes **trading profits**, **technical services**, etc.

**Article 10/11/12 (Dividends/Interest/Royalties):**
- **Withholding tax relief**: Domestic rates (e.g., 25%) reduced to treaty rates (5-15% dividends, 0-10% interest/royalties)
- Critical for **repatriating profits** from concession operations

**Article 24 (Non-Discrimination):**
- Prevents discriminatory taxation of foreign investors vs. domestic operators
- Important protection in concession regimes where fiscal terms are set by domestic law

**Example:** UK-Norway Tax Treaty

The **UK-Norway DTC** specifically addresses **North Sea petroleum operations**:
- Assigns **exclusive taxing rights** to the state where extraction occurs (even if operator is resident in the other state)
- Prevents double taxation on North Sea profits
- Critical for cross-border fields (e.g., shared Norwegian-UK reservoirs)

### 4.3 Tax Treaty Interaction with Non-Proprietorial Regimes (PSCs)

**Limited but Critical Application:**

PSC regimes interact differently with tax treaties:

**Classic PSC (No Separate Tax):**
- If government's profit oil share is **in lieu of tax**, the contractor pays **no corporate income tax**
- Tax treaty provisions on **business profits** (Article 7) are **largely irrelevant**
- **Withholding tax** provisions (Articles 10-12) still apply to dividends, interest, royalties paid by contractor

**Tax/Royalty PSC (Hybrid):**
- Contractor pays CIT on **profit oil share**
- Tax treaty **fully applies** to this CIT liability
- **Tax credit relief** in contractor's home country is critical to avoid double taxation

**Key Tax Treaty Issue: Characterization of Payments**

**Question:** Is the government's **profit oil share** in a PSC considered a **royalty** (subject to withholding tax) or **sovereign income** (not subject to treaty)?

**Answer (Majority View):**
- Profit oil share is **not a royalty** under Article 12 OECD Model
- **Rationale**: It is the government's share of production as **resource owner**, not payment for use of property
- **Tax treaty withholding** does **not apply** to profit oil

**Implication:** Tax treaties provide **less benefit** in classic PSC regimes compared to concession regimes, as the primary fiscal mechanism (profit oil) is outside treaty scope.

## 5. Worked Example 1: BIT Protection in Proprietorial vs. PSC Regime

═══════════════════════════════════════════
**WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Impact of Fiscal Change - BIT Protection Comparison**
═══════════════════════════════════════════

**Facts:**

Two identical oil companies operate in similar projects in Country A (proprietorial concession regime) and Country B (PSC regime). Both countries have BITs with the investor's home country (USA).

**Scenario:** Both host governments introduce a new **30% windfall tax** on oil revenues when prices exceed $80/barrel.

| **Item** | **Country A (Concession)** | **Country B (PSC)** |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Governance** | Proprietorial concession | PSC with frozen law clause |
| **Original fiscal terms** | 10% royalty + 30% CIT = 37% marginal rate | 70/30 profit oil split (government 70%) |
| **New measure** | +30% windfall tax on revenue > $80/bbl | +30% windfall tax on revenue > $80/bbl (despite frozen law clause) |
| **BIT** | USA-Country A BIT (FET, expropriation protection, ISDS) | USA-Country B BIT (identical terms) |

**Required:**

1. Analyze the investor's legal position under each regime
2. Assess the likelihood of successful BIT claim in each scenario

**Analysis:**

**Country A (Proprietorial Concession):**

**Step 1: Contractual Position**
- The investor holds a **license** under domestic petroleum law, **not a bilateral contract** with the state
- **No stabilization clause** exists (concession terms are set by legislation)
- **Conclusion:** No contractual breach claim available

**Step 2: BIT Protection Analysis**

The investor can invoke the **USA-Country A BIT** on the following grounds:

1. **Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) Breach:**
   - Windfall tax represents **arbitrary change** in fiscal framework
   - If imposed **retroactively** on existing licenses, violates **legitimate expectations**
   - **Precedent:** *Occidental v. Ecuador*, *Petrobart v. Kyrgyzstan* - tribunals found sudden tax increases breached FET

2. **Indirect Expropriation:**
   - If the 30% windfall tax reduces investment value by >50%, may constitute **indirect expropriation**
   - **Test:** Whether measure has "substantial deprivation" effect (not necessarily total)
   - **Precedent:** *Yukos v. Russia* - excessive taxation found to be expropriatory

**Step 3: ISDS Claim Likelihood**

| **Element** | **Assessment** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **FET breach** | **High likelihood** - sudden fiscal change without consultation likely violates legitimate expectations |
| **Indirect expropriation** | **Moderate likelihood** - depends on severity (30% revenue tax likely substantial but not total deprivation) |
| **Compensation potential** | Difference between actual ROI and expected ROI (typically 40-60% of claim) |

**Expected Outcome:** **60-70% chance** of successful claim; potential compensation of **30-50%** of lost value.

---

**Country B (PSC with Frozen Law Clause):**

**Step 1: Contractual Position**
- The investor has a **bilateral PSC contract** with Country B's government/NOC
- PSC includes **frozen law stabilization clause**: "No legislative change enacted after the Effective Date shall affect the fiscal terms of this Contract"
- **Conclusion:** Windfall tax application constitutes **direct breach of contract**

**Step 2: Contractual Remedies**

The investor can pursue:

1. **ICC Arbitration** (per PSC arbitration clause):
   - Claim: Breach of frozen law clause
   - Remedy: Injunction preventing windfall tax application OR damages equal to tax amount

2. **Economic Equilibrium Adjustment** (if PSC includes equilibrium clause):
   - Trigger renegotiation to restore **contractor's internal rate of return (IRR)**
   - Mechanism: Reduce government profit oil share to offset windfall tax impact

**Step 3: BIT Protection Analysis (Additional Layer)**

In addition to contractual claims, the investor can invoke the **USA-Country B BIT**:

1. **FET Breach:**
   - Violating **stabilization commitment** breaches **legitimate expectations**
   - **Stronger claim** than in Country A because expectations are **contractually anchored**

2. **Umbrella Clause** (if BIT includes one):
   - Many BITs contain **"umbrella clauses"** elevating contractual obligations to treaty level
   - **Effect:** Breach of PSC frozen law clause = breach of BIT
   - **Precedent:** *SGS v. Philippines*, *Eureko v. Poland* - umbrella clauses upheld contractual commitments

**Step 4: ISDS Claim Likelihood**

| **Element** | **Assessment** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Contract breach (ICC arbitration)** | **Very high likelihood** - clear violation of frozen law clause |
| **FET breach (ISDS)** | **Very high likelihood** - contractual expectations violated |
| **Umbrella clause** | **High likelihood** (if BIT contains umbrella clause) - contract breach = treaty breach |
| **Compensation potential** | **Full compensation** for windfall tax amount (100% of damages) |

**Expected Outcome:** **85-95% chance** of successful claim; potential **full compensation** for windfall tax burden.

---

**Comparative Conclusion:**

| **Aspect** | **Concession + BIT (Country A)** | **PSC + BIT (Country B)** |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Primary claim basis** | BIT (FET, expropriation) | Contract breach + BIT (dual recourse) |
| **Strength of claim** | Moderate (relies on general FET principle) | Very Strong (contractual + treaty violations) |
| **Success probability** | 60-70% | 85-95% |
| **Compensation level** | Partial (30-50% of loss) | Full (100% of windfall tax) |
| **Dispute forum** | ICSID (BIT arbitration only) | ICC (contract) and/or ICSID (BIT) - investor's choice |

**Key Takeaway:** **PSC regimes with stabilization clauses + BITs** provide **significantly stronger investor protection** against fiscal changes than **concession regimes with BITs alone**. The dual protection layer (contract + treaty) yields both higher success probability and greater compensation.

**COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:**

| **Metric** | **Country X (Concession)** | **Country Y (PSC)** |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Source country taxes** | $114.8M (royalty + CIT) | $206.25M (profit oil + CIT) |
| **Government take (pre-WHT)** | 32.8% | 58.9% |
| **Dividend WHT (domestic rate)** | 25% | 20% |
| **Dividend WHT (treaty rate)** | 5% | 10% |
| **WHT tax savings from treaty** | $27.04M (20% relief) | $6.875M (10% relief) |
| **Total government take (incl. WHT)** | 34.7% | 63.0% |
| **Net cash to investor** | $128.44M | $129.38M |
| **Investor effective return** | 36.7% of revenue | 37.0% of revenue |

**Key Observations:**

1. **Government Take:** PSC regime (63.0%) generates **nearly double** the government revenue of the concession regime (34.7%), despite similar project economics.

2. **Tax Treaty Impact:**
   - **Concession regime:** Treaty relief is **very significant** (20% reduction in WHT = $27M savings)
   - **PSC regime:** Treaty relief is **moderate** (10% reduction in WHT = $6.9M savings)
   - **Reason:** In concessions, dividends are the **primary repatriation mechanism**; in PSCs, the **profit oil share** (not subject to WHT) is primary, reducing treaty leverage

3. **Investor Net Return:** Despite much higher government take in the PSC (63% vs. 35%), the investor's **net return is similar** (37.0% vs. 36.7%) because:
   - PSC provides **full cost recovery** before profit split
   - Concession regime has **royalty on gross revenue** (reduces investor share regardless of profitability)

4. **Tax Treaty Value:**
   - **Concession regime:** Tax treaties provide **substantial economic benefit** ($27M savings)
   - **PSC regime:** Tax treaties provide **limited benefit** ($7M savings) because profit oil mechanism bypasses treaty scope

**Conclusion:**

**Tax treaties are more economically significant in proprietorial (concession) regimes** than in PSC regimes because:
- Concessions rely on **dividends** for repatriation (subject to WHT and treaty relief)
- PSCs use **profit oil allocation** as primary revenue mechanism (not subject to WHT)

However, **PSC regimes generate higher government take** (63% vs. 35%) while maintaining similar investor returns, demonstrating the **fiscal efficiency** of production sharing mechanisms.

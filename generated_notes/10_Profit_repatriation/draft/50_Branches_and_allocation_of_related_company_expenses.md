# 50. Branches and Allocation of Related Company Expenses

## Introduction

Unlike **subsidiaries**, which may deduct **arm's length charges** for services provided by parent companies, **branches (permanent establishments)** cannot "pay" their head office or related group companies in the traditional sense—they are part of the **same legal entity**. Instead, **head office expenses** are **allocated** to branches based on **economic attribution** principles under the **OECD Authorised OECD Approach (AOA)**. The AOA treats branches as functionally separate enterprises for calculating attributable profits.

The fundamental challenge: determining which expenses incurred by the head office (or other parts of the enterprise) should be **attributable** to the branch's activities and therefore **deductible** in calculating the branch's taxable profits.

Tax authorities scrutinize expense allocations to branches for:
1. **Excessive allocations**: Head office shifting costs to high-tax branches to erode the tax base
2. **Double deductions**: Same expense deducted by both head office and branch
3. **Non-attributable expenses**: Shareholder-level costs with no connection to branch activities

For multinational oil and gas companies, proper expense allocation is critical for **petroleum tax compliance**, **transfer pricing documentation**, and **tax treaty disputes**.

## 1. OECD Authorised OECD Approach (AOA) - Expense Allocation Framework

### 1.1 Separate Entity Fiction

The **2008 OECD Report on Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments** (incorporated into **Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention**) treats the PE as a **hypothetically separate and independent enterprise** for profit calculation.

**Key Principle**: Attribute to the PE the profits it would have earned if it were a **separate enterprise** performing the **same or similar functions**, using the **same or similar assets**, and assuming the **same or similar risks**.

### 1.2 Two-Step Analysis

**Step 1: Functional and Factual Analysis**

Identify:
- **Functions performed** by PE: Exploration, drilling, production, marketing, logistics
- **Assets used** by PE: Tangible (rigs, platforms, pipelines) and intangible (licenses, technology)
- **Risks assumed** by PE: Who bears geological risk, price risk, operational risk, political risk?
- **Key Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking (KERT) functions**: Where are critical commercial decisions made? KERT functions determine which entity assumes significant risks and corresponding profits.

**Step 2: Attribution of Profits**

Determine:
- **Capital attribution**: Equity and debt allocated to PE based on risk-weighted assets
- **Internal dealings**: Recognize notional transactions between PE and head office (e.g., PE "purchases" services from head office)
- **Expense allocation**: Allocate head office costs that **directly or indirectly support PE activities**
- **Arm's length pricing**: Apply transfer pricing methods to internal dealings

### 1.3 Internal Dealings - Expense Allocation

**Three Categories of Head Office Expenses**:

| Category | Description | Deductible by PE? | Allocation Method |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Direct PE expenses** | Costs incurred exclusively for PE (e.g., PE-specific legal fees, local staff) | YES - Full deduction | Direct attribution (100% to PE) |
| **Indirect shared expenses** | Costs benefiting multiple parts of enterprise (e.g., group IT, HR, treasury) | YES - Proportionate deduction | Allocation key (revenue, headcount, assets) |
| **Shareholder/stewardship expenses** | Costs relating to head office's role as owner (e.g., board oversight, investor relations) | VARIES by jurisdiction | Often NOT deductible (or limited allocation) |

---

## 2. Allocation Methodologies

### 2.1 Common Allocation Keys

**Revenue-Based Allocation**:

```
PE's Allocated Expense = Total Head Office Expense × (PE Revenue / Total Enterprise Revenue)

Example:
Head office IT costs: $10M
PE revenue: $200M (20% of total group revenue $1,000M)
PE allocated IT expense: $10M × 20% = $2M
```

**Headcount-Based Allocation**:

```
PE's Allocated Expense = Total Head Office Expense × (PE Headcount / Total Headcount)

Example:
Head office HR costs: $5M
PE headcount: 150 employees (15% of total 1,000 employees)
PE allocated HR expense: $5M × 15% = $750K
```

**Asset-Based Allocation**:

```
PE's Allocated Expense = Total Head Office Expense × (PE Assets / Total Enterprise Assets)

Example:
Head office insurance costs: $8M
PE assets: $500M (25% of total assets $2,000M)
PE allocated insurance: $8M × 25% = $2M
```

**Time/Usage-Based Allocation** (most accurate for services):

```
PE's Allocated Expense = Total Head Office Expense × (Time Spent on PE / Total Time)

Example:
Head office legal department costs: $3M
Time records show 30% of legal hours spent on PE matters
PE allocated legal expense: $3M × 30% = $900K
```

### 2.2 Multiple Allocation Keys

**Best Practice**: Use **function-specific allocation keys** tailored to each expense category.

**Example**:

| Head Office Expense | Total Amount | Allocation Key | PE Allocation Basis | PE Allocated Amount |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Executive management | $10M | Revenue | 20% | $2M |
| HR and payroll | $5M | Headcount | 15% | $750K |
| IT infrastructure | $8M | Usage (servers, licenses) | 18% | $1.44M |
| Treasury and finance | $4M | Assets managed | 25% | $1M |
| Legal department | $3M | Time tracking | 30% | $900K |
| Board of directors | $2M | NOT allocated | 0% | $0 |
| **Total** | **$32M** | | | **$6.09M** |

---

## 3. Jurisdictional Positions on Head Office Expense Deductibility

### 3.1 Liberal Jurisdictions (Broad Deductibility)

**Netherlands**:
- PE may deduct **reasonable allocation** of head office expenses
- Requires **demonstrable benefit** to PE activities
- Documentation: Allocation methodology, business purpose

**Singapore**:
- PE may deduct head office expenses if **wholly and exclusively** incurred for PE business
- Allocation based on **reasonable** and **consistent** methodology
- Tax authority may request supporting documentation

### 3.2 Restrictive Jurisdictions (Limited Deductibility)

**UK**:
- **No deduction** for general management or administration expenses of head office
- **Exception**: Specific expenses **directly attributable** to PE (e.g., PE-specific R&D, marketing)
- Rationale: Prevent double deduction (head office already deducts in home jurisdiction)

**Australia** (pre-2017 reforms):
- PE could deduct **arm's length charge** for head office services
- Post-2017: AOA adopted; PE may deduct expenses based on **functional analysis** (more restrictive)

**India**:
- **No deduction** for head office general management/administration
- **Exception**: Specific technical or professional services directly attributable to PE
- Expense must be **wholly and exclusively** for PE operations
- Documentation: Detailed functional analysis, allocation methodology, comparables

### 3.3 Specific Issues for Oil & Gas

**Geological & Geophysical (G&G) Expenses**:

```
Head office geoscience team conducts regional basin studies benefiting multiple PEs

Question: Can Norwegian PE deduct allocated share of G&G costs?

Liberal jurisdictions (Netherlands, Singapore): YES, if allocation reasonable
Restrictive jurisdictions (UK, India): MAYBE - only if studies directly relate to Norwegian license areas
```

**Exploration Risk**:

```
Head office assumes exploration risk and funds early-stage drilling across global portfolio

Question: Should PE deduct allocated share of dry hole costs from other jurisdictions?

OECD AOA: NO - each PE responsible only for risks it assumes under functional analysis
Exception: If head office provides "exploration insurance" to PE, PE may recognize internal premium payment
```

---

## 4. Documentation Requirements

### 4.1 OECD Guidelines - Chapter VII

**Required Documentation for Expense Allocation**:

1. **Description of allocated expenses**: Nature of services/costs (IT, legal, HR, treasury, management)
2. **Allocation methodology**: Allocation keys used, rationale for selection
3. **Calculation worksheets**: Detailed calculations showing derivation of PE's share
4. **Functional analysis**: Demonstration that PE receives benefit from allocated expenses
5. **Consistency**: Evidence that same methodology applied across all PEs (not cherry-picking)

### 4.2 Best Practices

**Written Internal Policy**:
- Document group-wide expense allocation policy
- Specify allocation keys for each expense category
- Require annual review and approval by tax function

**Time Tracking**:
- For professional services (legal, technical, tax), maintain detailed time records
- Allocate based on actual time spent on PE matters

**Benchmarking**:
- Compare total allocated expenses to what PE would pay third-party service providers
- If allocation significantly exceeds market rates, tax authority may disallow excess

## WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Head Office Expense Allocation - Norwegian Branch

### Facts

**TransAtlantic Energy Inc.** (U.S. parent) operates a **branch (PE)** in **Norway** engaged in offshore oil production in the North Sea. The branch is the company's only international operation.

**Head Office Expenses (2024)** (incurred in U.S.):

| Expense Category | Annual Amount | Description |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Executive management** | $8M | CEO, CFO, COO salaries and overhead |
| **Geoscience department** | $12M | Regional basin studies, reservoir engineering, geophysics |
| **Legal department** | $4M | Corporate legal, contracts, litigation |
| **IT infrastructure** | $6M | Servers, software licenses, cybersecurity |
| **HR and administration** | $3M | Payroll, benefits, recruitment, training |
| **Board of directors** | $2M | Board fees, meetings, D&O insurance |
| **Investor relations** | $1.5M | Shareholder communications, SEC filings |
| **Corporate development** | $3.5M | M&A analysis, strategic planning |
| **Total** | **$40M** | |

**Norway Branch Data**:

- Revenue: $500M (company's only operation → 100% of group revenue)
- Headcount: 200 employees (out of 250 total → 80%)
- Assets: $1.2 billion (out of $1.5 billion total → 80%)

**Norway Tax Law**: PE may deduct **reasonable allocation** of head office expenses if **directly or indirectly attributable** to Norwegian operations and supported by documentation.

### Required

1. Determine **deductible allocation** for each expense category
2. Calculate **total deductible head office expenses** for Norway branch
3. Assess **documentation** required to defend allocation

### Analysis

**Step 1: Functional Analysis**

**Questions**:
- Which head office functions **directly support** Norway operations?
- Which costs would Norway branch **incur independently** if it were a standalone company?
- Which costs are **shareholder-level expenses** with no benefit to branch?

**Step 2: Expense-by-Expense Allocation**

**Executive Management ($8M)**:

```
Nature: CEO, CFO, COO provide strategic oversight, financial management, operational leadership

Benefit to Norway branch: YES - Norway operations receive executive guidance, strategic planning, financial oversight

Allocation key: REVENUE (Norway = 100% of revenue)
BUT: Adjust for shareholder activities (e.g., 20% of executive time on investor relations, board matters)

Allocable amount: $8M × 80% (excluding shareholder time) × 100% (revenue share) = $6.4M
Deductible by Norway branch: $6.4M
```

**Geoscience Department ($12M)**:

```
Nature: Regional basin studies, reservoir engineering, drilling optimization

Functional analysis:
- Regional basin studies: Cover North Sea + potential future areas (e.g., Barents Sea, Gulf of Mexico)
- Reservoir engineering: 90% dedicated to Norway operations
- Drilling optimization: 100% dedicated to Norway

Allocation:
- Basin studies: Allocate 70% to Norway (primary area of focus) = $3M × 70% = $2.1M
- Reservoir engineering: $6M × 90% = $5.4M
- Drilling optimization: $3M × 100% = $3M

Total deductible: $2.1M + $5.4M + $3M = $10.5M
```

**Legal Department ($4M)**:

```
Nature: Corporate legal, contract negotiations, litigation

Time records analysis:
- Norway contracts and PSC negotiations: 40% of time
- General corporate (U.S. compliance, employment): 30%
- Parent company litigation: 20%
- M&A and corporate restructuring: 10%

Allocable to Norway: 40% (direct benefit)
Deductible: $4M × 40% = $1.6M
```

**IT Infrastructure ($6M)**:

```
Nature: Servers, software licenses, cybersecurity, helpdesk

Allocation key: USAGE
- Norway employees: 200 out of 250 (80%)
- Norway data storage: 75% of total data
- Software licenses: 80% of licenses used by Norway staff

Average allocation: (80% + 75% + 80%) / 3 = 78.3%
Deductible: $6M × 78.3% = $4.7M
```

**HR and Administration ($3M)**:

```
Nature: Payroll, benefits, recruitment, training

Allocation key: HEADCOUNT
Norway: 200 out of 250 employees = 80%
Deductible: $3M × 80% = $2.4M
```

**Board of Directors ($2M)**:

```
Nature: Board oversight, governance, shareholder representation

Allocation: SHAREHOLDER EXPENSE (not attributable to Norway operations)
Rationale: Board serves shareholders, not Norway branch specifically
Deductible: $0
```

**Investor Relations ($1.5M)**:

```
Nature: Shareholder communications, SEC filings, analyst relations

Allocation: SHAREHOLDER EXPENSE
Deductible: $0
```

**Corporate Development ($3.5M)**:

```
Nature: M&A analysis, strategic planning, new venture evaluation

Functional analysis:
- Norway expansion opportunities: 30% ($1.05M)
- New country entry analysis (not yet committed): 50% ($1.75M)
- Parent company strategic initiatives: 20% ($700K)

Deductible by Norway: Only direct Norway expansion costs: $1.05M
Rationale: Speculative new country analysis does NOT benefit Norway branch
```

**Step 3: Total Deductible Allocation**

| Expense Category | Total | Allocated to Norway | Allocation % |
|------------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Executive management | $8M | $6.4M | 80% |
| Geoscience department | $12M | $10.5M | 87.5% |
| Legal department | $4M | $1.6M | 40% |
| IT infrastructure | $6M | $4.7M | 78.3% |
| HR and administration | $3M | $2.4M | 80% |
| Board of directors | $2M | $0 | 0% |
| Investor relations | $1.5M | $0 | 0% |
| Corporate development | $3.5M | $1.05M | 30% |
| **Total** | **$40M** | **$26.65M** | **66.6%** |

**Step 4: Tax Impact**

```
Norway branch taxable income (before head office allocation):
Revenue: $500M
Operating costs (Norway-incurred): $300M
Depreciation: $50M
EBITDA: $150M

Less: Head office allocated expenses: $26.65M
Taxable income: $123.35M

Norway petroleum tax at 78%: $96.2M

If NO head office allocation allowed:
Taxable income: $150M
Norway tax: $117M

Tax savings from head office deduction: $117M - $96.2M = $20.8M
```

**Step 5: Documentation Required**

1. **Expense allocation policy**: Written document describing allocation keys for each category
2. **Time records**: Legal department time tracking showing 40% spent on Norway matters
3. **Functional analysis**: Demonstration that geoscience, IT, HR services benefit Norway operations
4. **Shareholder vs. operational expense memo**: Explanation why board/IR costs NOT allocated
5. **Benchmarking** (optional but helpful): Comparison to third-party service provider costs for similar services
6. **Approval**: Board or management approval of allocation methodology

## WORKED EXAMPLE 2: Disallowance of Excessive Allocation - UK Branch

### Facts

**PetroGlobal Corporation** (U.S. parent) operates a **UK branch** engaged in **North Sea E&P** and **downstream refining**. The company has operations in **15 countries**.

**Head Office Expense Allocation (2024)**:

PetroGlobal allocates $50M of head office expenses to UK branch, calculated as follows:

| Expense Category | Total | UK Allocation (Revenue-Based: 25%) |
|------------------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| Executive management | $20M | $5M |
| Technical services (engineering, geoscience) | $40M | $10M |
| IT and administration | $16M | $4M |
| Legal and compliance | $12M | $3M |
| Treasury and finance | $24M | $6M |
| Corporate overhead (board, IR, M&A) | $8M | $2M |
| Strategic planning and business development | $80M | $20M |
| **Total** | **$200M** | **$50M** |

**UK Branch Revenue**: $1 billion (25% of total group revenue $4 billion)

**HMRC Audit Position** (2025):

**HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)** (UK tax authority) challenges the **$50M allocation**, asserting:

1. **Single allocation key** (revenue) is **not appropriate** for all expense categories
2. **Strategic planning** ($20M allocated) includes costs for **other jurisdictions** with no benefit to UK
3. **Corporate overhead** ($2M) is **shareholder expense**, not deductible
4. **No contemporaneous documentation** demonstrating benefit to UK branch

HMRC proposes to **disallow $30M** of the allocation, resulting in:

```
Increased UK taxable income: $30M
Additional UK tax at 25%: $7.5M
Penalties for incorrect return (careless): $2.25M (30% of tax)
Interest (2 years): $1.2M
Total assessment: $10.95M
```

### Required

1. **Assess HMRC's position** for each expense category
2. Calculate **defensible allocation** under UK law and OECD AOA
3. **Recommend restructuring** of allocation methodology

### Analysis

**Step 1: UK Law on PE Expense Deductibility**

**UK Position**: Branch may NOT deduct **general management or administrative expenses** of head office.

**Exception**: Branch may deduct **specific expenses directly attributable** to UK operations.

**OECD AOA**: UK adopted AOA in 2018; branch profits calculated based on functional analysis.

**Step 2: Assess Each Expense Category**

**Executive Management ($5M allocated)**:

```
HMRC challenge: General management is NOT deductible under UK law
PetroGlobal position: UK branch requires executive oversight; cost allocation is reasonable

Analysis:
UK law: General executive oversight is HEAD OFFICE function, not branch expense
Exception: If CEO/CFO provides SPECIFIC services to UK (e.g., negotiating UK acquisition), those costs may be deductible

Defensible allocation: $500K (estimate of UK-specific executive time on North Sea asset acquisition)
Disallowed: $5M - $500K = $4.5M
```

**Technical Services ($10M allocated)**:

```
HMRC challenge: 25% revenue allocation is not based on actual usage

Analysis:
Request time records showing engineering/geoscience hours spent on UK operations
If time records show 30% of technical department hours on UK projects, allocation based on usage is defensible

Defensible allocation: $40M × 30% (time-based) = $12M
BUT: If no time records, HMRC may disallow entirely or limit to conservative estimate

Conservative estimate (without time records): $6M (50% of claimed amount)
Adjustment: $10M claimed - $6M allowed = $4M disallowed
```

**IT and Administration ($4M allocated)**:

```
HMRC challenge: UK branch could purchase IT services independently; not head office service

Analysis:
IT infrastructure (servers, licenses) benefits all operations including UK
UK headcount: 400 out of 2,000 total = 20%
20% allocation is reasonable (vs. 25% revenue-based allocation claimed)

Defensible allocation: $16M × 20% (headcount) = $3.2M
Adjustment: $4M - $3.2M = $800K disallowed
```

**Legal and Compliance ($3M allocated)**:

```
HMRC challenge: What legal services specifically benefit UK branch?

Analysis:
Review invoices and matter descriptions:
- UK regulatory compliance: $1.5M (fully attributable)
- General corporate legal (U.S.): $1M (NOT attributable)
- Multi-jurisdictional contracts (including UK): $500K (partially attributable)

Defensible allocation: $1.5M + $500K = $2M
Adjustment: $3M - $2M = $1M disallowed
```

**Treasury and Finance ($6M allocated)**:

```
HMRC challenge: Treasury is head office function, not branch expense

Analysis:
UK branch benefits from group treasury (cash management, FX hedging, debt financing)
BUT: UK law does NOT allow deduction for general head office finance functions

Defensible allocation: $0 (UK law restricts deductibility)
Adjustment: $6M disallowed
```

**Corporate Overhead ($2M allocated)**:

```
HMRC challenge: Board, IR, M&A costs are shareholder expenses

Analysis:
OECD AOA: Shareholder activities NOT attributable to PE
UK law: NOT deductible

Defensible allocation: $0
Adjustment: $2M disallowed
```

**Strategic Planning ($20M allocated)**:

```
HMRC challenge: $80M total strategic planning includes new country entry, M&A in other jurisdictions

Analysis:
Request breakdown of $80M strategic planning costs:
- UK North Sea expansion studies: $10M (attributable)
- New country entry (West Africa, Latin America): $50M (NOT attributable to UK)
- Group-wide strategic planning: $20M (NOT attributable)

Defensible allocation: $10M (UK-specific expansion studies only)
Adjustment: $20M - $10M = $10M disallowed
```

**Step 3: Summary of Adjustments**

| Expense Category | Claimed | Defensible | Disallowed |
|------------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Executive management | $5M | $500K | $4.5M |
| Technical services | $10M | $6M | $4M |
| IT and administration | $4M | $3.2M | $800K |
| Legal and compliance | $3M | $2M | $1M |
| Treasury and finance | $6M | $0 | $6M |
| Corporate overhead | $2M | $0 | $2M |
| Strategic planning | $20M | $10M | $10M |
| **Total** | **$50M** | **$21.7M** | **$28.3M** |

**HMRC proposed disallowance**: $30M
**Actual defensible disallowance**: $28.3M

**HMRC position is largely correct.**

**Step 4: Tax Impact**

```
UK branch taxable income adjustment: $28.3M
Additional UK tax at 25%: $7.075M

Penalties:
Careless inaccuracy: 30% of tax = $2.12M
BUT: Reasonable care defense possible if allocation methodology was documented

Settlement negotiation:
Accept tax adjustment: $7.075M
Argue reasonable care (mitigate penalties): Request penalty reduction to 15% = $1.06M
Interest: $1.2M

Proposed settlement: $7.075M + $1.06M + $1.2M = $9.34M (vs. $10.95M HMRC assessment)
```

**Step 5: Restructuring Recommendations**

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Implement function-specific allocation keys**:
   - Technical services: TIME TRACKING (actual hours on UK projects)
   - IT: HEADCOUNT or USAGE (licenses, data storage)
   - Legal: MATTER-BASED (invoices for UK-specific work)
   - Strategic planning: DIRECT ATTRIBUTION (UK expansion studies only)

2. **Eliminate non-deductible allocations**:
   - Board, investor relations, general corporate overhead: NOT allocated to UK branch
   - Treasury and finance: Eliminated (UK law does not permit deduction)

3. **Prepare contemporaneous documentation**:
   - Functional analysis showing which head office functions benefit UK
   - Time records for professional services
   - Allocation methodology memo approved by CFO/tax director
   - Benchmarking against third-party service provider costs

**Long-Term Restructuring**:

**Option 1: Establish UK Service Company**:

```
Create "PetroGlobal UK Services Ltd" to provide technical, legal, and IT services to UK branch
- Hire UK-based personnel (10-15 **Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs)**)
- Charge arm's length fees to branch (subject to transfer pricing rules)
- Benefit: Clear documentation of services, arm's length pricing, substance in UK

Cost: $2-3M annual operating costs for UK service company
Benefit: Eliminates HMRC challenges on expense allocation, provides defensible structure
```

**Option 2: Convert Branch to Subsidiary**:

```
Incorporate UK subsidiary to replace branch structure
- UK subsidiary can deduct arm's length management fees/service charges (subject to **transfer pricing (TP)** rules)
- Provides clearer legal separation and expense deductibility

Consideration: Dividend **Withholding Tax (WHT)** on repatriation (0% under U.S.-UK treaty)
Trade-off: Clearer expense deductibility vs. loss of direct **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)** for branch taxes
```

**Recommendation**: Implement **Option 1** (UK service company) for technical services, maintain branch structure for upstream operations. Accept reduced head office allocations in line with UK law restrictions ($21.7M vs. $50M claimed).

---

## Conclusion

Allocation of head office expenses to branches (PEs) requires rigorous **functional analysis** under the OECD AOA, treating the PE as a functionally separate enterprise. Jurisdictions vary significantly in their approach:

- **Liberal jurisdictions** (Netherlands, Singapore): Allow reasonable allocations with documentation
- **Restrictive jurisdictions** (UK, India): Permit only direct attributable expenses; disallow general management

For oil and gas multinationals, **proper expense allocation** is critical for:
1. **Maximizing deductions** in high-tax petroleum jurisdictions
2. **Avoiding double taxation** (head office deduction + PE disallowance)
3. **Withstanding tax authority audits** with contemporaneous documentation

**Key principles**:

1. **OECD AOA**: Two-step functional analysis and arm's length attribution
2. **Allocation keys**: Function-specific keys (time, usage, headcount) more defensible than single revenue-based allocation
3. **Shareholder expenses**: Board, IR, general corporate overhead NOT attributable to PEs
4. **Documentation**: Contemporaneous functional analysis, allocation methodology, time records, benchmarking
5. **Jurisdictional differences**: Understand local law restrictions on head office expense deductibility

Understanding these principles requires ability to **identify deductible vs. non-deductible allocations**, **calculate defensible amounts**, and **recommend allocation methodologies** with supporting documentation.

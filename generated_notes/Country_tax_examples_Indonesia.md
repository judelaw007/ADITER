## 1. Core Framework and Legal Foundations

### 1.1 Statutory Basis

Indonesia's petroleum fiscal regime operates under a **Production Sharing Contract (PSC) framework** established by:

- **Oil and Gas Law No. 22/2001**: Fundamental legislation abolishing state monopoly and establishing upstream regulatory framework
- **Government Regulation No. 79/2010**: Governs income from state participation in oil and gas operations
- **Government Regulation No. 27/2017**: Regulates profit sharing in production sharing contracts
- **Government Regulation No. 53/2017**: Governs treatment of gross revenue in gross split PSCs
- **Government Regulation No. 23/2020**: Implements national strategic projects including petroleum developments

The Indonesian Constitution (Article 33) vests ownership of all natural resources, including petroleum, in the state. Foreign contractors cannot own petroleum reserves but receive **economic rights** to production through PSCs.

### 1.2 Role of SKK Migas

**SKK Migas (Satuan Kerja Khusus Pelaksana Kegiatan Usaha Hulu Minyak dan Gas Bumi)** is the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas Business Activities, established under Law 22/2001 to replace Pertamina's regulatory functions.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Negotiates and signs PSCs on behalf of the government
- Monitors cost recovery claims and contractor compliance
- Approves work programs and budgets (WP&B)
- Administers domestic market obligation (DMO)
- Audits petroleum operations and cost allocations

SKK Migas operates under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) but maintains operational independence in contract administration.

## 2. Traditional PSC Structure (Cost Recovery PSC)

### 2.1 First Tranche Petroleum (FTP)

**First Tranche Petroleum** is an allocation of gross production taken **before** cost recovery, representing the government's minimum share regardless of costs.

**FTP Allocation:**
- Typically **20% of gross production** (oil and gas combined)
- Split between government and contractor using the **equity split ratio**
- Common split: Government 85% / Contractor 15% of FTP

**Tax Treatment:**
- FTP received by contractor is **taxable income**
- FTP provides government with immediate revenue even in high-cost periods

### 2.2 Cost Recovery Mechanism

After FTP deduction, contractors recover **operating costs** and **DMO costs** from remaining production:

**Recoverable Costs:**
- **Operating costs**: Exploration, development, production expenses
- **DMO costs**: Costs of delivering domestic market obligation volumes
- **Investment credit**: 17% uplift on capital expenditures (pre-production only)

**Cost Recovery Ceiling:**
- Oil: 90% of available production (after FTP)
- Gas: 100% of available production (after FTP)

**Unrecovered Costs:** Carried forward indefinitely without time limitation.

**Transfer Pricing Controls:**
- Presidential Regulation 36/2017 subjects cost recovery to arm's length pricing
- SKK Migas audits affiliated party transactions for compliance with OECD Guidelines
- Safe harbor provisions available for routine services

### 2.3 Equity Split and Contractor's Share

After cost recovery, **profit oil/gas** is split between government and contractor:

**Typical Split Ratios:**
- Oil: Government 85% / Contractor 15%
- Gas: Government 65% / Contractor 35%

**Domestic Market Obligation (DMO):**
- Contractor must supply 25% of its equity production to domestic market
- DMO price: Typically 10-25% discount to international market price
- DMO creates implicit tax through below-market pricing

## 3. Gross Split PSC (Post-2017 Reform)

### 3.1 Government Regulation 52/2017 Framework

Indonesia introduced **Gross Split PSCs** to simplify fiscal administration and eliminate cost recovery disputes.

**Key Features:**
- **No cost recovery**: Contractor funds all costs from its production share
- **Base split**: Government 57% / Contractor 43% (oil); Government 52% / Contractor 48% (gas)
- **Variable components**: Split adjusted for progressive factors and contractual terms
- **No FTP**: Allocation occurs directly from gross production

**Split Adjustment Factors:**

| Factor | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Location | 0-8% | Remote/frontier areas favor contractor |
| Reservoir depth | 0-4% | Greater depths increase contractor share |
| Infrastructure | 0-6% | Lack of infrastructure benefits contractor |
| Reservoir type | 0-10% | Unconventional resources favor contractor |
| Production stage | 0-5% | Early production benefits contractor |
| Cumulative production | 0-10% | Higher cumulative production reduces contractor share |

**Example Calculation:**
Base split (oil): 57% (Gov) / 43% (Contractor)
Plus adjustments: +8% (remote location) +4% (deep reservoir)
**Final split: 45% (Gov) / 55% (Contractor)**

### 3.2 Comparison: Traditional vs. Gross Split PSC

| Element | Traditional PSC | Gross Split PSC |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| FTP | Yes (20%) | No |
| Cost Recovery | Yes (up to 90%/100%) | No |
| Investment Credit | Yes (17%) | No |
| Audit Burden | High (cost verification) | Low (no cost recovery) |
| Government Risk | Low (guaranteed FTP + profit oil) | Higher (no FTP backstop) |
| Contractor Risk | Lower (cost recovery) | Higher (funds all costs) |
| Administrative Complexity | High | Low |

**Trend (2023-2025):** Indonesia favors gross split PSCs for new blocks to reduce administrative burden, but existing cost recovery PSCs continue under original terms due to **stabilization clauses**.

## 4. Tax Obligations

### 4.1 Corporate Income Tax

**Tax Rate:** 22% (reduced from 25% in 2020 under Job Creation Law)
**Tax Base:** Contractor's share of profit oil/gas plus FTP allocation
**Deductions:** Costs are deducted through cost recovery mechanism, not tax deductions

**Branch vs. Corporation:**
- Foreign contractors typically operate as **permanent establishments (branches)**
- Branch profits subject to **branch profits tax** in addition to corporate tax

### 4.2 Branch Profits Tax

**Rate:** 20% (may be reduced under tax treaties)
**Base:** After-tax profits deemed repatriated
**Treaty Relief:** UK-Indonesia treaty reduces BPT to 10%; Singapore-Indonesia to 15%

### 4.3 Withholding Taxes

**Dividends:** 20% (domestic law); reduced under treaties (typically 10-15%)
**Interest:** 20% (domestic law); reduced under treaties (typically 10%)
**Royalties:** 20% (domestic law); technical service fees also subject to WHT
**Technical Services:** 2% WHT on gross payments to residents; 20% to non-residents

**VAT on Petroleum:** Petroleum activities generally **exempt from VAT** under Government Regulation 48/2017, though input VAT may not be fully recoverable.

## 5. Worked Example: Traditional Indonesian PSC Calculation

**Facts:**
- Gross oil production: 1,000,000 barrels
- Oil price: $80/barrel
- Operating costs incurred: $30 million
- Investment credit: $3 million (17% of capex)
- FTP: 20% of gross production
- Equity split: Government 85% / Contractor 15%
- Corporate tax rate: 22%
- Branch profits tax: 20%

**Calculation Waterfall:**

**Step 1: Gross Revenue**
1,000,000 barrels × $80 = **$80,000,000**

**Step 2: First Tranche Petroleum (FTP)**
FTP volume: 1,000,000 × 20% = 200,000 barrels
FTP value: 200,000 × $80 = **$16,000,000**

Government FTP: $16,000,000 × 85% = **$13,600,000**
Contractor FTP: $16,000,000 × 15% = **$2,400,000**

**Step 3: Available for Cost Recovery**
Remaining production: 1,000,000 - 200,000 = 800,000 barrels
Value: 800,000 × $80 = **$64,000,000**

**Step 4: Cost Recovery**
Total recoverable costs: $30,000,000 + $3,000,000 = **$33,000,000**
Cost recovery ceiling (90% of available): $64,000,000 × 90% = $57,600,000
Contractor recovers: **$33,000,000** (within ceiling)

**Step 5: Profit Oil**
Profit oil: $64,000,000 - $33,000,000 = **$31,000,000**

Government profit oil: $31,000,000 × 85% = **$26,350,000**
Contractor profit oil: $31,000,000 × 15% = **$4,650,000**

**Step 6: Contractor's Total Share**
FTP share: $2,400,000
Profit oil share: $4,650,000
Cost recovery: $33,000,000
**Total contractor revenue: $40,050,000**

**Step 7: Tax Calculations**

**Corporate Income Tax Base:**
Taxable income = FTP + Profit oil = $2,400,000 + $4,650,000 = **$7,050,000**
(Note: Costs recovered through cost recovery mechanism, not deducted again)

Corporate tax: $7,050,000 × 22% = **$1,551,000**

**After-tax profit:** $7,050,000 - $1,551,000 = **$5,499,000**

**Branch Profits Tax:**
BPT base: $5,499,000
BPT: $5,499,000 × 20% = **$1,099,800**

**Step 8: Net Contractor Take**
Total revenue: $40,050,000
Less corporate tax: ($1,551,000)
Less branch profits tax: ($1,099,800)
**Net contractor cash: $37,399,200**

**Step 9: Government Take Analysis**
Government FTP: $13,600,000
Government profit oil: $26,350,000
Corporate tax: $1,551,000
Branch profits tax: $1,099,800
**Total government take: $42,600,800**

**Government take percentage:** $42,600,800 / $80,000,000 = **53.25%**

**Economic Summary:**
- Contractor's net economic share: 46.75%
- Government's total economic share: 53.25%
- Effective tax rate on contractor's pre-tax profit: ~37.6%

## 6. Recent Developments (2023-2025)

**January 2023:** Ministry of Finance issued Regulation PMK-66/2023 clarifying transfer pricing documentation for petroleum contractors, requiring master files and local files aligned with BEPS Action 13.

**June 2024:** SKK Migas announced new investment incentives for marginal fields, offering enhanced contractor splits (up to 25% profit oil) for fields producing below 5,000 BOPD.

**September 2024:** Indonesia signed Memorandum of Understanding with Malaysia and Thailand for cross-border unitization, establishing framework for joint development areas with coordinated PSC terms.

**2025 Outlook:** Government considering further reductions to branch profits tax rate in new PSCs to attract foreign investment, potentially establishing 10% rate for frontier exploration areas.

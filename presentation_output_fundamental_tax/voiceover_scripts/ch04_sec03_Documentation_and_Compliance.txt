Slide: Documentation and Compliance

So when we talk about transfer pricing documentation requirements,  OECD Three-Tier Approach (BEPS Action 13, finalized in 2015): Tier 1: Master File High-level overview of MNE group Global business operations Overall transfer pricing policies Global allocation of income and economic activity Audience: All tax administrations where group operates Tier 2: Local File Detailed transfer pricing analysis for local entity Controlled transactions Comparability analysis Financial information Audience: Local tax administration Tier 3: Country-by-Country Report (CbCR) Aggregate data on global allocation of income, taxes, economic activity Required for MNEs with consolidated revenue exceeding EUR 750 million Filed in parent jurisdiction; exchanged automatically under Common Reporting Standard (CRS)

Information includes: Revenue, profit before tax, income tax paid and accrued, stated capital, accumulated earnings, employees, tangible assets (by jurisdiction) Contemporaneous Documentation: Most jurisdictions require documentation prepared contemporaneously (at time of transaction or before tax return filing). Penalties may apply for failure to maintain adequate documentation. Now, advance pricing agreements (apas) is interesting.  Purpose: Prospective agreement between taxpayer and tax authority (or multiple authorities) on transfer pricing methodology for specified transactions over fixed period (typically 3-5 years). Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreement (APA): Agreement with single tax authority

Bilateral APA: Agreement between taxpayer and two tax authorities (preferred for double tax certainty) Multilateral APA: Agreement involving three or more tax authorities Certainty and predictability Avoids costly audits and disputes Reduces double taxation risk Facilitates tax planning and forecasting Pre-filing: Informal discussions with tax authority Formal application: Detailed submission with proposed methodology Evaluation: Tax authority review and analysis Negotiation: Discussion of methodology and terms Execution: Formal agreement signed Annual compliance: Report demonstrating compliance with APA terms Energy Sector APAs: Common for: Commodity pricing (crude oil, gas sales) Service arrangements (technical services, contract operations)

Cost-sharing agreements (exploration, development) Financing arrangements (intragroup loans, guarantees) Now, penalties and enforcement is interesting.  Transfer Pricing Adjustments: Tax authorities may adjust reported taxable income if transfer prices do not reflect arm's length principle. Penalties: Typical penalty regimes vary by jurisdiction but commonly include: Documentation penalties: Failure to maintain/provide contemporaneous documentation (ranging from EUR 1,250 to EUR 100,000 or more per reporting period, depending on jurisdiction and severity) Accuracy penalties: Understatement of tax due to transfer pricing (typically 20-40% of tax adjustment in many jurisdictions; for example, US applies 20% for substantial misstatements and 40% for gross misstatements)

Enhanced penalties: Gross negligence or intentional disregard (50-200% in some jurisdictions) Penalty Protection: Many jurisdictions provide penalty relief if taxpayer: Maintained contemporaneous documentation Conducted reasonable comparability analysis Applied reasonable transfer pricing method Made reasonable efforts to comply Correlative Adjustments: Article 9(2) OECD Model requires corresponding adjustment in other jurisdiction to avoid double taxation. Not all treaties include Article 9(2); absence may result in unrelieved double taxation.

# 48. Subsidiaries and Deductible Expenses

## Introduction

Multinational oil and gas groups frequently allocate **head office expenses** to foreign subsidiaries for centralized services such as **management**, **technical support**, **procurement**, **treasury**, and **shared administrative functions**. These **management fees** and **service charges** are deductible by subsidiaries, subject to strict requirements:

1. **Transfer pricing compliance**: Charges must be **arm's length** under OECD Guidelines and Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 482
2. **Genuine services**: Services must be **actually rendered** and provide economic benefit
3. **Documentation**: Contemporaneous records must demonstrate **value** and **reasonableness**
4. **Withholding tax**: Cross-border payments may be subject to **WHT** (often 5-15% under treaties)

Tax authorities intensely scrutinize related-party expense allocations, particularly when subsidiaries are in **high-tax jurisdictions** and parent companies are in **low-tax jurisdictions**. Post-**Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)**, the focus is on **substance over form**: whether charges reflect genuine value creation or constitute **base erosion**.

## 1. Categories of Deductible Expenses

### 1.1 Management Fees

**Definition**: Charges for general **management, strategic oversight, and administrative support** provided by parent company or regional headquarters to subsidiaries.

**Common Components**:
- Executive management time allocated to subsidiary oversight
- Corporate governance and compliance support
- Strategic planning and business development
- Financial reporting and consolidation
- Legal and regulatory affairs

**Transfer Pricing Challenge**: Management fees are often **difficult to benchmark** due to lack of comparable third-party transactions.

### 1.2 Technical Services

**Definition**: Specialized **engineering, geological, or operational expertise** provided by parent or group service company.

**Oil & Gas Examples**:
- Reservoir engineering and simulation
- Drilling optimization and well design
- Production facilities engineering
- **Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE)** compliance
- Project management for major capex

**Pricing Methods**: Typically **Cost Plus** (total costs + arm's length markup) or **Comparable Uncontrolled Price** (if external benchmarks available).

### 1.3 Shared Services

**Definition**: **Centralized administrative functions** performed by a dedicated service company and allocated to group entities.

**Common Functions**:
- Human resources (payroll, recruitment, training)
- IT infrastructure and software licenses
- Accounting and tax compliance
- Procurement and supply chain management
- Insurance and risk management

**Allocation Keys**: Costs allocated based on **usage metrics** (headcount, revenue, assets, transaction volume).

### 1.4 Corporate Overhead

**Definition**: General head office costs that **benefit the group** as a whole but do not constitute specific services to subsidiaries.

**Examples**:
- Board of directors compensation
- Investor relations
- Corporate communications
- Executive office costs
- General legal and audit fees (for parent company statutory accounts)

**Deductibility Issue**: Tax authorities may **deny deductions** for corporate overhead that provides **no direct benefit** to subsidiaries. OECD Guidelines distinguish between:
- **Shareholder activities**: NOT deductible (e.g., parent company listing costs, dividend policy decisions)
- **Group-wide stewardship**: MAY be allocable if demonstrable benefit to subsidiaries

---

## 2. Transfer Pricing Requirements

### 2.1 OECD Guidelines - Chapter VII (Intra-Group Services)

**Benefit Test**: Service charges are arm's length only if:

1. **Economic/commercial value**: Service provides value that would cause an independent enterprise to pay or perform in-house
2. **Actual provision**: Service is actually performed (not merely a charge for being part of a group)

**Example - Shareholder vs. Stewardship**:

| Activity | Classification | Allocable? |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Parent company listing on stock exchange | Shareholder activity | NO |
| Group-wide insurance program negotiation | Stewardship/service | YES (if demonstrable cost savings) |
| Parent board of directors fees | Shareholder activity | NO |
| Group tax strategy development | Stewardship | MAYBE (if benefits subsidiaries) |
| Subsidiary-specific tax compliance | Service | YES |

### 2.2 U.S. IRC Section 482 - Services Cost Method (SCM)

**Safe Harbor**: For **low-margin covered services**, charges may be allocated at **cost with NO MARKUP**, provided:

**Eligibility Criteria** (Revenue Procedure 2007-13):

1. **Covered services**: 101 specified activities (HR, payroll, IT, legal, etc.) OR services with markup ≤ 7%
2. **No significant risk**: Services do not contribute to **fundamental competitive advantages**
3. **No duplication**: Subsidiary is not duplicating the service
4. **Documentation**: Books and records maintained showing allocation method

**Benefits**:
- **No markup required**: Allocate at total services costs
- **Reduced documentation**: Simplified transfer pricing analysis
- **Penalty protection**: Avoids IRC Section 6662 penalties if properly documented

**Limitations**:
- Does NOT apply to: Manufacturing, production, **extraction**, R&D, distribution, financial transactions
- **Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) considerations**: **Services Cost Method (SCM)** services may be exempt from BEAT

### 2.3 Cost Plus Method (CPM)

**For Non-Covered Services**: Technical services, geological support, engineering, etc. The **Cost Plus Method (CPM)** applies when services do not qualify under SCM.

**Formula**:

```
Arm's Length Charge = Total Costs × (1 + Markup%)

Where:
Total Costs = Direct labor + Direct materials + Allocated indirect costs
Markup% = Arm's length profit margin for comparable services
```

**Benchmark Markup Ranges** (oil & gas services):

| Service Type | Typical Markup Range |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Engineering and design | 10-25% |
| Geological/geophysical | 15-30% |
| Drilling optimization | 15-25% |
| HSE compliance | 8-15% |
| Procurement | 5-12% |

**Comparables**: Use external service providers (Halliburton, Schlumberger, Wood Group, etc.) as benchmarks for operating margins on similar services.

## 3. Documentation Requirements

### 3.1 Contemporaneous Documentation

**Timing**: Documentation must exist **at the time the tax return is filed** (not prepared after audit notification).

**Required Elements** (Treasury Regulation § 1.6662-6):

1. **Description of services**: Detailed explanation of what services are provided
2. **Functional analysis**: Who performs services, what functions, risks assumed, assets used
3. **Allocation methodology**: How costs are allocated (headcount, revenue, assets, usage)
4. **Pricing analysis**: Application of transfer pricing method (SCM, CPM, **Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP)**)
5. **Comparables**: Benchmarking analysis if using CPM or profit-based methods
6. **Benefits**: Explanation of economic value to recipient subsidiary
7. **Contracts**: Written agreements documenting service terms

### 3.2 Service Agreements

**Best Practice**: Establish **written intercompany service agreements** covering:

- **Scope of services**: Detailed description of services to be provided
- **Pricing methodology**: How charges will be calculated (cost allocation, markup)
- **Billing frequency**: Monthly, quarterly, annual
- **Payment terms**: Currency, payment deadline, interest on late payment
- **Contract period**: Term and renewal/termination provisions
- **Governing law**: Jurisdiction and dispute resolution

**Example - Technical Services Agreement**:

```
Agreement between GlobalPetro Inc. (U.S. parent) and GlobalPetro Norge AS (Norway subsidiary)

Services: Reservoir engineering, drilling optimization, production facilities design

Pricing: Total direct costs (employee time at internal cost + external consultants)
         + allocated overheads (25% of direct labor) + 15% markup

Billing: Quarterly in arrears, invoiced within 30 days of quarter-end

Payment: 60 days from invoice date, USD
```

---

## 4. Tax Authority Challenges

### 4.1 Common Disallowance Grounds

**1. No Economic Benefit**:
- Services do not provide demonstrable value to subsidiary
- Subsidiary could not/would not pay for services as independent entity
- Duplicate services already available locally

**2. Excessive Charges**:
- Markup exceeds arm's length range
- Allocation methodology inflates subsidiary's cost share
- Costs include shareholder activities

**3. Lack of Substance**:
- No contemporaneous documentation
- No contracts or invoices
- Services not actually performed (no time records, deliverables)

**4. Base Erosion**:
- High-tax subsidiary making large payments to low-tax parent
- Erosion of local tax base without corresponding economic activity

### 4.2 Penalty Exposure

**U.S. - IRC Section 6662**: **20-40% penalties** on transfer pricing adjustments if:
- Taxpayer does not have contemporaneous documentation
- Charges exceed 200% of arm's length amount (or less than 50%)

**UK - Transfer Pricing Penalties**: Up to **30% of understated tax** for careless or deliberate errors.

**Other Jurisdictions**: Many countries impose **documentation penalties** (e.g., €25,000 in Germany) for failure to maintain/produce transfer pricing records.

---

## 5. Withholding Tax on Management Fees

### 5.1 Domestic Law Rates

Many jurisdictions impose **WHT on management fees** paid to non-residents:

| Jurisdiction | Domestic WHT Rate | Treaty Classification |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **India** | 20% (increased from 10% in 2023) | Article 12 (Fees for Technical Services) |
| **Brazil** | 15-25% | Article 7 (Business Profits) if treaty |
| **Angola** | 15% (increased from 6.5%) | Article 12 or Article 7 (depends on treaty) |
| **Nigeria** | 10% (non-residents) | Article 12 (Fees for Technical Services) |
| **China** | 10% | Article 7 (Business Profits) |

### 5.2 Treaty Relief

**Article 7 (Business Profits)**: If management fees classified as **business profits** rather than royalties/**Fees for Technical Services (FTS)**:
- **No WHT** if service provider has no **Permanent Establishment (PE)** in source country
- Most favorable for service providers

**Article 12 (Royalties)** or **Fees for Technical Services (FTS)** (UN Model Article 12):
- **Reduced WHT rates** (typically 5-15% under treaties)
- Source country retains taxing rights even without PE

**Example - Treaty Shopping**:

```
U.S. parent could provide services directly to Indian subsidiary:
U.S.-India Treaty: Management fees = Article 12 (FTS), 15-20% WHT

Alternatively, establish Netherlands service company:
Netherlands-India Treaty: Management fees = Article 7 (Business Profits), 0% WHT if no PE

Tax savings: 15-20% WHT eliminated (but requires substance in Netherlands)
```

## WORKED EXAMPLE: Management Fee Deductibility Challenge

### Facts

**PetroGlobal Inc.** (U.S. parent) provides management and technical services to its wholly-owned subsidiary **PetroGlobal Angola Lda.**, which operates offshore oil fields under a production sharing contract (PSC) with the Angolan government.

**2024 Service Charges**:

| Service Category | Annual Charge | Allocation Basis |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Corporate management** | $5,000,000 | Revenue share (Angola = 10% of group revenue) |
| **Technical services** (reservoir engineering, drilling support) | $8,000,000 | Direct time tracking + 20% markup |
| **Shared IT services** | $2,000,000 | Headcount (Angola = 15% of group headcount) |
| **Head office overhead** (CEO, CFO, board, investor relations) | $3,000,000 | Revenue share (10%) |
| **Total** | **$18,000,000** | |

**Angola Subsidiary Financials**:
- Revenue: $200M
- Operating income (before service charges): $80M
- Service charges: $18M
- Taxable income: $62M
- Angola tax rate: 50% (petroleum income tax)

**Angola Tax Authority Audit Position** (2025):

The **Autoridade Geral Tributária (AGT)** (Angola's tax authority) challenges **all $18M in service charges**, asserting:

1. **No contemporaneous documentation** provided within 30 days of request
2. **Excessive markup** on technical services (20% exceeds market rates)
3. **Corporate overhead** charges are **shareholder expenses** with no benefit to Angola subsidiary
4. **No written service agreements** exist

AGT proposes to **disallow $18M deduction**, resulting in:

```
Revised taxable income: $62M + $18M = $80M
Additional Angola tax: $18M × 50% = $9M
Penalties: $9M × 30% = $2.7M
Interest (2 years at 8%): $1.44M
Total assessment: $13.14M
```

**Parent Company Response**: PetroGlobal Inc. engages transfer pricing advisors to defend the deductions.

### Required

1. **Assess deductibility** of each service category under OECD Guidelines and Angola tax law
2. **Calculate defensible charges** based on arm's length principles
3. **Recommend documentation** and restructuring to mitigate future risk

### Analysis

**Step 1: Assess Each Service Category**

**Corporate Management ($5M)**:

```
Nature: General oversight, strategic planning, financial reporting consolidation
Allocation: 10% of group revenue → Angola subsidiary

OECD Benefit Test:
- Does service provide economic value? MAYBE (strategic planning has value, but general oversight may be shareholder activity)
- Would independent entity pay for this? UNLIKELY to pay $5M for general oversight

AGT Challenge: Valid concern that general management is shareholder expense

Defensible Amount: Reduce to services with direct benefit
- Strategic planning for Angola operations: $1M
- Financial reporting support specific to PSC accounting: $500K
- HSE and compliance oversight: $500K
Defensible charge: $2M (vs. $5M charged)

Adjustment: DISALLOW $3M
```

**Technical Services ($8M)**:

```
Nature: Reservoir engineering, drilling optimization, production facilities design
Allocation: Direct time tracking + 20% markup

OECD Benefit Test:
- Does service provide economic value? YES (specialized technical expertise)
- Would independent entity pay for this? YES (Angola subsidiary would hire external consultants if not provided by parent)

Comparables: External service providers (Halliburton, Schlumberger, Wood Group)
- Typical markup on cost-plus contracts: 10-18% for engineering services
- 20% markup is SLIGHTLY HIGH but within reasonable range

AGT Challenge: Documentation insufficient, but services clearly provided and beneficial

Defensible Amount: Reduce markup to 15% (midpoint of benchmark range)
Original: Direct costs $6.67M × 1.20 = $8M
Revised: Direct costs $6.67M × 1.15 = $7.67M
Defensible charge: $7.67M (vs. $8M charged)

Adjustment: DISALLOW $330K
```

**Shared IT Services ($2M)**:

```
Nature: Centralized IT infrastructure, software licenses, helpdesk
Allocation: 15% of group headcount (Angola has 150 of 1,000 employees)

OECD Benefit Test:
- Does service provide economic value? YES (IT infrastructure necessary for operations)
- Would independent entity pay for this? YES (alternative is duplicating IT infrastructure locally)

IRC Section 482 **Services Cost Method (SCM)**: Likely qualifies as "covered service" (IT support, software licensing)
- Can be allocated at COST with NO MARKUP
- Angola headcount allocation (15%) is reasonable

AGT Challenge: Documentation required showing allocation methodology

Defensible Amount: $2M is reasonable if properly documented
Services Cost Method: Total IT costs $13.33M × 15% = $2M (no markup)

Adjustment: ALLOW $2M (if documentation provided)
```

**Head Office Overhead ($3M)**:

```
Nature: CEO, CFO, board compensation, investor relations, corporate communications
Allocation: 10% of group revenue

OECD Benefit Test:
- Does service provide economic value? NO (shareholder activities)
- Would independent entity pay for this? NO (these are costs of being a public company, not services to subsidiary)

OECD Guidelines: Shareholder activities are NOT deductible
- Board of directors oversight of parent company: Shareholder activity
- Investor relations for parent company shares: Shareholder activity
- CEO/CFO time on group consolidation: Shareholder activity

AGT Challenge: Valid - these are not services to Angola subsidiary

Defensible Amount: $0

Adjustment: DISALLOW $3M
```

**Step 2: Calculate Defensible Charges**

```
Summary of Defensible Charges:

Corporate management: $2M (reduced from $5M)
Technical services: $7.67M (reduced from $8M)
Shared IT services: $2M (allowed as charged)
Head office overhead: $0 (disallowed from $3M)

Total defensible charges: $11.67M
Total charged: $18M
Total adjustments: $6.33M
```

**Revised Angola Tax Calculation**:

```
Operating income: $80M
Less: Defensible service charges: $11.67M
Taxable income: $68.33M
Angola tax at 50%: $34.17M

Original return:
Taxable income: $62M
Angola tax at 50%: $31M

Additional tax due: $34.17M - $31M = $3.17M
(vs. AGT's proposed $9M if all services disallowed)
```

**Step 3: Documentation and Restructuring Recommendations**

**Immediate Actions (Documentation)**:

1. **Prepare contemporaneous transfer pricing (TP) documentation**:
   - Functional analysis for each service category
   - Time records for technical services (employee hours, projects)
   - IT cost allocation model (show how 15% headcount ratio derived)
   - Comparables analysis for technical services markup (benchmark at 10-18%)

2. **Execute written service agreements**:
   - Separate agreements for technical services vs. shared services
   - Clearly define scope, deliverables, pricing methodology
   - Billing and payment terms

3. **Eliminate shareholder expenses**:
   - Cease charging corporate overhead (CEO/CFO/board costs)
   - Cease charging general management fees without specific benefit

4. **Reduce technical services markup**:
   - Adjust from 20% to 15% (midpoint of benchmark range)
   - Document comparable analysis supporting 15% markup

**Long-Term Restructuring**:

**Option 1: Establish Regional Service Company**:

```
Create "PetroGlobal Africa Services Ltd." (South Africa or Mauritius)
- Hire technical personnel (10-15 **Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs)**: reservoir engineers, drilling engineers)
- Provide services to Angola and other African subsidiaries
- Charge cost plus 12-15% markup (defensible with substance)
- Benefits:
  • Substance in service provider (real employees, local expertise)
  • Reduced WHT risk (African treaties often more favorable than U.S. treaties)
  • Credibility with tax authorities (genuine African technical capability)
```

**Option 2: Apply Services Cost Method**:

```
For covered services (IT, HR, accounting), document SCM election:
- Prepare Rev. Proc. 2007-13 documentation
- Allocate at COST (no markup)
- Reduces total charges but also reduces audit risk
- Benefits:
  • Safe harbor from penalties
  • Simplified documentation
  • Lower WHT (lower base amount)
```

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:

```
Current Disputed Amount: $6.33M in disallowed charges
Additional tax exposure: $3.17M + penalties $950K + interest $500K = $4.62M

Documentation Costs (one-time):
- Transfer pricing study: $150K
- Service agreements: $50K
- Systems for time tracking and allocation: $100K
Total: $300K

Annual Compliance Costs:
- TP documentation updates: $75K/year
- Audit defense reserve: $50K/year

Restructuring Costs (Regional Service Company):
- Entity formation: $50K
- Annual operating costs (substance): $1.5M/year
- But creates defensible structure for all African operations

Recommendation: Implement documentation improvements ($300K one-time + $125K/year ongoing)
Do NOT proceed with regional service company unless expanding African operations justify $1.5M annual cost
```

**Settlement Negotiation**:

**Proposed Settlement with AGT**:

```
Accept partial disallowance:
- Corporate management: Reduce from $5M to $2M (concede $3M)
- Technical services: Reduce from $8M to $7.67M (concede $330K)
- Head office overhead: Disallow entirely (concede $3M)
- Shared IT: Defend fully at $2M (with documentation)

Total concession: $6.33M
Additional tax: $3.17M
Request penalty waiver: Demonstrate good faith (reasonable cause defense)
Offer to pay interest: $500K

Total proposed settlement: $3.67M (vs. $13.14M AGT assessment)
Savings: $9.47M
```

---

## Conclusion

Deductibility of management fees and service charges between parent companies and subsidiaries requires rigorous **transfer pricing compliance**, **contemporaneous documentation**, and **demonstration of genuine economic benefit**. Tax authorities in high-tax jurisdictions (particularly petroleum-producing countries) intensely scrutinize these charges as potential **base erosion**.

**Key principles**:

1. **OECD Benefit Test**: Services must provide economic value that independent entity would pay for
2. **Shareholder vs. Stewardship**: Distinguish between shareholder activities (NOT deductible) and genuine services
3. **Documentation**: Contemporaneous records (service agreements, time tracking, allocation methodologies, comparables)
4. **Pricing Methods**: SCM for low-margin covered services, CPM for technical services, benchmarking required
5. **Withholding Tax**: Consider treaty classification (Article 7 vs. Article 12) and impact on net group cost

Understanding these principles requires ability to **classify service charges**, **assess deductibility**, **calculate arm's length prices**, and **recommend documentation/restructuring** with cost-benefit analysis.

# PART A

**You are required to answer BOTH questions from this Part.**

## Question 1 (25 marks)

Oil and gas resources were recently discovered in a developing country, whose tax authority has limited resources and expertise in energy resources taxation. The country is new to fossil fuel resources and has never previously had a petroleum fiscal regime.

You have been approached by an agent who seeks to use your expertise to help the country build a new petroleum fiscal regime.

**You are required to:**

**1) Discuss the different types of petroleum fiscal regime.** (21 marks)

**2) Recommend, with justification and based on the country's situation, a suitable fiscal regime to the agent.** (4 marks)

**Total: 25 marks**

## Question 2 (25 marks)

The government of Xantha approached Lucky Oil and Gas Exploration plc (Lucky Oil) for some technical services in relation to one of Xantha's oil and gas fields. Xantha requires Lucky Oil to provide seismic data acquisition, drilling and construction services on the oil and gas field. Lucky Oil requested a fee of £100 million for the seismic data services, and the following fees for drilling services:

- £150 million for drilling the first 100 metres; then
- £100 million per 50 metres up to a depth of 200 metres; then
- £200 million per 50 metres thereafter.

Should Lucky Oil undertake the job, it will encounter the following costs:

- £35 million for the seismic studies;
- £50 million for drilling the first 100 metres; then
- £60 million per 50 metres up to a depth of 200 metres; then
- £80 million per 50 metres after a 200-metre depth.

Solicitors and tax experts have advised Xantha to sign a service contract with Lucky Oil for the provision of the services. The terms of the contract will be as follows:

1) If the results of the seismic study suggest that oil and/or gas exists at a depth of less than 150 metres, Xantha will sign a pure service contract with Lucky Oil.

2) If the data suggests that oil and/or gas exists at a depth greater than 150 metres, then a risk service contract will be signed.

3) If oil and/or gas is then actually discovered at a depth of more than 100 metres, Lucky Oil will be entitled to recover its costs in addition to its fees. Lucky Oil will have to pay tax on its profits. Xantha charges corporate tax at a rate of 20%.

**You are required to:**

**1) Discuss the characteristics of the two types of service contract, and offer examples of countries that use service contracts.** (10 marks)

**2) Calculate Lucky Oil's profits under each type of service contract, in the event that:**

   **a) A pure service contract is signed but results of the seismic study indicate no oil or gas.** (3 marks)

   **b) A pure service contract is signed, and the seismic study results indicate the existence of oil and/or gas within a 150-metre depth.** (4 marks)

   **c) A risk service contract is signed, the seismic study results indicate the existence of oil and/or gas, and Xantha and Lucky Oil agree on a drilling depth of up to 250 metres.** (8 marks)

You may ignore any permanent establishment and/or withholding tax issues.

**Total: 25 marks**

# PART B

**You are required to answer ONE question from this Part.**

## Question 3 (20 marks)

"In Wälde's (2003) view, the proprietorial regime allows mineral owners to dispose of their resources as they see fit, and to secure the maximum possible payment in return for granting companies access. Furthermore, Abdo (2014) contends that the main concern of the proprietor is not to allow free access to its land or sea."

**You are required to:**

**1) Discuss the main features of a proprietorial regime for the governance of mineral resources.** (10 marks)

**2) To what extent do Production Sharing Agreements fit the description of a proprietorial regime?** (10 marks)

**Total: 20 marks**

---

## Question 4 (20 marks)

An energy company based in one country conducts exploration and drilling activities in several foreign jurisdictions.

**You are required to analyse the implications of tax treaties on the company's determination of a permanent establishment (PE) in the various host countries. Discuss how the definition and interpretation of PE clauses in tax treaties affect the company's tax liability and compliance obligations, providing examples from the energy sector.** (20 marks)

**Total: 20 marks**

---

# PART C

**You are required to answer TWO questions from this Part.**

## Question 5 (15 marks)

The governance of oil and gas resources is a key factor in determining the type of fiscal regime to be used by a given country. Two types of governance regime are linked to the types of fiscal system a country may use; these are proprietorial and non-proprietorial regimes, where both the natural resources and associated assets are in government ownership.

**You are required to discuss the similarities and differences between proprietorial and non-proprietorial governance regimes, and establish the connections between each of these governing regimes and the different types of petroleum fiscal system. Your discussion should focus on the tax laws, regulations and practices of the different systems.** (15 marks)

**Total: 15 marks**

---

## Question 6 (15 marks)

When taxing the revenue that arises from oil and gas production, some countries include ring-fencing provisions in their petroleum laws or in their exploration and production contracts. These ring-fencing provisions may have different scopes or objectives. They also have an impact on the taxation of oil and gas companies' profits and on government tax revenues.

**You are required to:**

**1) Explain the concept of ring-fencing in oil and gas contracts, and the different scopes of ring-fencing.** (5 marks)

**2) Discuss the impacts that ring-fencing may have on the taxation of oil and gas companies and on government tax revenues.** (10 marks)

**Total: 15 marks**

## Question 7 (15 marks)

The tax due diligence procedure is regularly a key feature in the context of an intended transaction. The goal of tax due diligence is to identify the tax-related opportunities and risks of a proposed transaction, and to gain new knowledge which facilitates the selection of an optimal transaction structure from a tax perspective.

In an oil and gas acquisition transaction, the buyer should review key information during the tax due diligence process. Information may be provided in a physical data room or an online data room, and the buyer can request specific documentation to be added to the data room.

**You are required to outline ten key issues that should be reviewed during the tax due diligence process by the buyer or its representatives.** (15 marks)

**Total: 15 marks**

---

## Question 8 (15 marks)

**You are required to explain the concepts of 'state equity' and 'carried interest' in the oil and gas industry, and analyse the tax and economic implications of these arrangements, including the role of state participation in the development of oil and gas resources and the allocation of risks and rewards between the state and the private sector.**

**You should include consideration of the impact of these arrangements on the investment climate and long-term sustainability of the oil and gas industry, provide examples of how state equity and carried interest have been implemented in practice, and evaluate the effectiveness of these arrangements.** (15 marks)

**Total: 15 marks**

## 1. Core Framework and Legal Foundations

### 1.1 Statutory Basis

Indonesia's petroleum fiscal regime operates under a **Production Sharing Contract (PSC) framework** established by:

- **Law No. 22 of 22 November 2001** (Oil and Gas Law): Fundamental legislation ending state monopoly and establishing upstream regulatory framework
- **Presidential Regulation No. 9 of 2013** (as amended by Presidential Regulation No. 36 of 2018): Establishes SKK Migas and governs management of upstream oil and gas activities
- **Government Regulation No. 79 of 2010**: Governs income from state participation in oil and gas operations
- **Government Regulation No. 27 of 2017**: Regulates profit sharing and provides incentives for upstream energy development in production sharing contracts
- **Government Regulation No. 52 of 2017** (as amended by MEMR Regulation No. 52 of 2017): Establishes gross split PSC framework
- **Government Regulation No. 53 of 2017**: Governs tax treatment in gross split PSCs

The Indonesian Constitution (Article 33) vests ownership of all natural resources, including petroleum, in the state. This constitutional principle reflects Indonesia's sovereignty over natural resources and ensures the state maintains ultimate ownership even as private contractors develop reserves. Foreign contractors cannot own petroleum reserves but receive **economic rights** to production through PSCs, entitling them to a share of production in-kind or cash equivalent as compensation for exploration and development investments and operational risks.

### 1.2 Role of SKK Migas

**SKK Migas (Satuan Kerja Khusus Pelaksana Kegiatan Usaha Hulu Minyak dan Gas Bumi)** is the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas Business Activities, established under **Presidential Regulation No. 9 of 2013** to replace the previous regulatory body BPMIGAS, which was declared unconstitutional by Indonesia's Constitutional Court on 13 November 2012.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Negotiates and signs PSCs on behalf of the Indonesian government
- Monitors cost recovery claims and contractor compliance with approved work programs and budgets
- Approves annual work programs and budgets (WP&B) submitted by contractors
- Administers domestic market obligation (DMO) requirements
- Audits petroleum operations and cost allocations to ensure compliance with arm's length pricing and recoverable cost definitions

SKK Migas operates under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) but maintains operational independence in contract administration. The head of SKK Migas reports directly to the President of Indonesia.

## 2. Traditional PSC Structure (Cost Recovery PSC)

### 2.1 First Tranche Petroleum (FTP)

**First Tranche Petroleum** is an allocation of gross production taken **before** cost recovery, representing the government's minimum share regardless of costs incurred. FTP serves a similar function to royalties in concession regimes but is split between government and contractor according to the equity split ratio rather than taken entirely by the government.

**FTP Allocation:**
- Typically **20% of gross production** (oil and gas combined) under most PSCs, though some contracts in frontier areas have 15% FTP
- Split between government and contractor using the **equity split ratio** applicable to profit oil/gas
- Common split: Government 85% / Contractor 15% of FTP for oil

**Tax Treatment:**
- FTP received by contractor constitutes **taxable income** subject to corporate income tax
- FTP provides government with immediate revenue even during high-cost exploration or development periods before cost recovery

### 2.2 Cost Recovery Mechanism

After FTP deduction, contractors recover **operating costs** and **DMO costs** from remaining production. The cost recovery mechanism is a defining feature of Indonesia's traditional PSC, allowing contractors to recoup capital and operating expenditures from production before profit sharing.

**Recoverable Costs:**
- **Operating costs**: Exploration, development, and production expenses that meet SKK Migas criteria for reasonableness and necessity
- **DMO costs**: Costs of delivering domestic market obligation volumes to satisfy Indonesia's energy security requirements
- **Investment credit**: Uplift ranging from **17% to 27%** of qualified capital expenditures (pre-production only), varying by PSC and field location

**Cost Recovery Discipline:**
Indonesia generally does not impose a fixed monetary cap on cost recovery. However, unrecovered costs are carried forward indefinitely without time limitation until fully recovered from future production.

**Transfer Pricing Controls:**
SKK Migas audits affiliated party transactions for compliance with arm's length pricing principles consistent with OECD Guidelines. Safe harbor provisions are available for routine services to reduce administrative burden.

### 2.3 Equity Split and Contractor's Share

After cost recovery, **profit oil/gas** is split between government and contractor according to negotiated percentages that reflect field risk, water depth, distance from infrastructure, and reservoir characteristics.

**Typical Split Ratios:**
- Oil: Government 85% / Contractor 15%
- Gas: Government 65% / Contractor 35% (gas receives more favorable contractor split due to higher development costs and domestic pricing obligations)

**Domestic Market Obligation (DMO):**
- Contractor must supply **25% of its equity production** to the domestic market to support Indonesia's energy security
- DMO pricing: Typically sold at a discount to international market prices; for oil, the DMO fee equals **25% of the Indonesian Crude Price (ICP)** after an initial 60-month period from first delivery
- DMO creates an implicit tax through below-market pricing, reducing contractor revenues

## 3. Gross Split PSC (Post-2017 Reform)

### 3.1 Government Regulation 52/2017 Framework

Indonesia introduced **Gross Split PSCs** via MEMR Regulation No. 8 of 2017 (as amended by MEMR Regulation No. 52 of 2017) to simplify fiscal administration and eliminate cost recovery disputes that created audit burdens and delays in revenue recognition. The gross split structure shifts cost risk entirely to contractors while providing administrative simplicity and immediate revenue recognition for the government.

**Key Features:**
- **No cost recovery**: Contractor funds all costs from its production share without reimbursement mechanism
- **Base split**: Government 57% / Contractor 43% (oil); Government 52% / Contractor 48% (gas)
- **Variable and progressive components**: Split adjusted based on field-specific factors and economic conditions
- **No FTP**: Allocation occurs directly from gross production without pre-allocation to government

**Split Adjustment Factors:**

| Factor | Adjustment Range | Description |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Location | 0-8% | Remote/frontier areas favor contractor to incentivize exploration |
| Reservoir depth | 0-4% | Greater depths increase contractor share due to higher costs |
| Infrastructure | 0-6% | Lack of existing infrastructure benefits contractor |
| Reservoir type | 0-10% | Unconventional resources (tight gas, CBM) favor contractor |
| Production stage | 0-5% | Early/secondary production benefits contractor; mature fields favor government |
| Cumulative production | 0-10% | Higher cumulative production reduces contractor share (progressive element) |
| Oil prices | Variable | Higher prices reduce contractor share; lower prices increase contractor share |
| Domestic content | 0-4% | Higher Indonesian content increases contractor share |

**Example Calculation:**
```
Base split (oil): 57% (Gov) / 43% (Contractor)
Plus variable adjustments:
  +8% (remote location)
  +4% (deep reservoir)
  +6% (no infrastructure)
Final split: 45% (Gov) / 55% (Contractor)
```

### 3.2 Comparison: Traditional vs. Gross Split PSC

| Element | Traditional PSC | Gross Split PSC |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| FTP | Yes (typically 20%) | No |
| Cost Recovery | Yes (no fixed ceiling) | No |
| Investment Credit | Yes (17-27% uplift) | No |
| Audit Burden | High (extensive cost verification) | Low (no cost recovery audits) |
| Government Risk | Low (guaranteed FTP + profit oil) | Higher (no FTP minimum revenue) |
| Contractor Risk | Lower (cost recovery protection) | Higher (funds all costs from production share) |
| Administrative Complexity | High | Low |
| DMO | 25% of equity production | 25% of contractor share |

The Indonesian government has favored gross split PSCs for new licensing rounds since 2017 to reduce administrative burden and expedite revenue collection. Existing cost recovery PSCs continue under original terms due to **stabilization clauses** that protect contractors from fiscal regime changes.

## 4. Tax Obligations

### 4.1 Corporate Income Tax

**Tax Rate:** 22% (reduced from 25% in 2020 under Law No. 11 of 2 November 2020, the Job Creation Law)

**Tax Base:** Contractor's share of profit oil/gas plus FTP allocation (under traditional PSC); contractor's gross production share (under gross split PSC)

**Deductions:** Under traditional PSCs, costs are deducted through the cost recovery mechanism rather than as tax deductions, preventing double deduction. Under gross split PSCs, no deductions are available as contractors fund costs from their production share.

**Branch vs. Corporation:**
- Foreign contractors typically operate as **permanent establishments (branches)** rather than incorporating Indonesian subsidiaries
- Branch profits are subject to **branch profits tax** in addition to corporate income tax

### 4.2 Branch Profits Tax

**Rate:** 20% on after-tax profits (may be reduced under applicable tax treaties)

**Base:** After-tax profits deemed repatriated to the foreign head office, regardless of whether actual remittance occurs

**Treaty Relief:** UK-Indonesia tax treaty reduces branch profits tax to 10%; Singapore-Indonesia treaty reduces to 15%

**Exemption:** Branch profits tax can be fully exempted if profits are reinvested in Indonesia according to specified criteria

### 4.3 Withholding Taxes

**Dividends:** 20% on distributions to non-resident shareholders (domestic law); reduced under tax treaties (typically 10-15%); 10% for resident individuals; exempt for resident companies meeting specified conditions

**Interest:** 20% on payments to non-residents (domestic law); reduced under tax treaties (typically 10%)

**Royalties and technical fees:** 20% on payments to non-residents

**Technical Services:** 2% withholding tax on gross payments to resident service providers; 20% to non-resident service providers

**VAT on Petroleum:** Petroleum activities under PSCs are generally **exempt from VAT** under Minister of Finance Regulation No. 67/PMK.03/2020, though contractors may face limitations on recovering input VAT incurred on purchases.

## 5. Worked Example: Traditional Indonesian PSC Calculation

**Facts:**
- Gross oil production: 1,000,000 barrels
- Oil price: $80/barrel
- Operating costs incurred: $30 million
- Investment credit: $3 million (17% of capital expenditures qualifying for uplift)
- FTP: 20% of gross production
- Equity split: Government 85% / Contractor 15% (both FTP and profit oil)
- Corporate tax rate: 22%
- Branch profits tax: 20%

**Calculation Waterfall:**

**Step 1: Gross Revenue**
```
1,000,000 barrels × $80 = $80,000,000
```

**Step 2: First Tranche Petroleum (FTP)**
```
FTP volume: 1,000,000 × 20% = 200,000 barrels
FTP value: 200,000 × $80 = $16,000,000

Government FTP: $16,000,000 × 85% = $13,600,000
Contractor FTP: $16,000,000 × 15% = $2,400,000
```

**Step 3: Available for Cost Recovery**
```
Remaining production: 1,000,000 - 200,000 = 800,000 barrels
Value: 800,000 × $80 = $64,000,000
```

**Step 4: Cost Recovery**
```
Total recoverable costs: $30,000,000 + $3,000,000 = $33,000,000
Contractor recovers: $33,000,000 (no ceiling applies; full recovery available)
```

**Step 5: Profit Oil**
```
Profit oil: $64,000,000 - $33,000,000 = $31,000,000

Government profit oil: $31,000,000 × 85% = $26,350,000
Contractor profit oil: $31,000,000 × 15% = $4,650,000
```

**Step 6: Contractor's Total Share**
```
FTP share: $2,400,000
Profit oil share: $4,650,000
Cost recovery: $33,000,000
Total contractor revenue: $40,050,000
```

**Step 7: Tax Calculations**

**Corporate Income Tax Base:**
```
Taxable income = FTP + Profit oil = $2,400,000 + $4,650,000 = $7,050,000
(Note: Costs already recovered through cost recovery mechanism; not deducted again for tax purposes)

Corporate tax: $7,050,000 × 22% = $1,551,000
```

**After-tax profit:**
```
$7,050,000 - $1,551,000 = $5,499,000
```

**Branch Profits Tax:**
```
BPT base: $5,499,000
BPT: $5,499,000 × 20% = $1,099,800
```

**Step 8: Net Contractor Take**
```
Total revenue: $40,050,000
Less corporate tax: ($1,551,000)
Less branch profits tax: ($1,099,800)
Net contractor cash: $37,399,200
```

**Step 9: Government Take Analysis**
```
Government FTP: $13,600,000
Government profit oil: $26,350,000
Corporate tax: $1,551,000
Branch profits tax: $1,099,800
Total government take: $42,600,800

Government take percentage: $42,600,800 / $80,000,000 = 53.25%
```

**Summary Table:**

| Item | Amount ($ million) | Percentage of Gross Revenue |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Gross Revenue | 80.0 | 100.0% |
| Government FTP | (13.6) | (17.0%) |
| Contractor FTP | (2.4) | (3.0%) |
| Cost Recovery | (33.0) | (41.3%) |
| Government Profit Oil | (26.4) | (32.9%) |
| Contractor Profit Oil | (4.7) | (5.8%) |
| Corporate Income Tax | (1.6) | (1.9%) |
| Branch Profits Tax | (1.1) | (1.4%) |
| **Net Contractor Cash** | **37.4** | **46.7%** |
| **Total Government Take** | **42.6** | **53.3%** |

**Economic Analysis:**
- Contractor's net economic share: 46.7% of gross revenue (comprising cost recovery, FTP share, and profit oil share net of taxes)
- Government's total economic share: 53.3% (comprising FTP share, profit oil share, and all tax collections)
- Effective tax rate on contractor's pre-tax income (FTP + profit oil): 37.6%

**Study Note Key Points:**

1. Indonesia operates a **Production Sharing Contract (PSC) framework** with constitutional state ownership of petroleum resources (Article 33)
2. **SKK Migas** was established via Presidential Regulation No. 9 of 2013 to replace BPMIGAS after constitutional court ruling
3. **Two PSC models coexist**: Traditional cost recovery PSC (with FTP, cost recovery, and profit sharing) and Gross Split PSC (direct production sharing without cost recovery)
4. **Traditional PSC structure**: 20% FTP taken before cost recovery, no fixed cost recovery ceiling, profit oil split typically 85/15 (government/contractor) for oil and 65/35 for gas
5. **Gross Split PSC**: Base split 57/43 (oil) or 52/48 (gas) adjusted by variable factors (location, depth, infrastructure, reservoir type) and progressive factors (production, prices)
6. **Investment credit** of 17-27% applies to qualified capital expenditures in traditional PSCs only; gross split PSCs eliminate this uplift
7. **Domestic Market Obligation (DMO)** requires contractors to supply 25% of equity production to domestic market at discounted pricing (25% of ICP for oil)
8. **Corporate taxation**: 22% income tax (reduced from 25% in 2020) plus 20% branch profits tax (reducible under tax treaties)
9. **Withholding taxes**: 20% standard rate on dividends, interest, royalties, and technical services to non-residents; 2% on services to residents; VAT exempt for petroleum operations
10. Government take under traditional PSC typically ranges 50-60% depending on cost levels and field profitability; gross split PSC government take determined by base split plus adjustments

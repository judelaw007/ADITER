# Interaction with PSCs and Joint Operating Agreements

## 1. Core Framework: Technical Services in PSC and JOA Contexts

### 1.1 Intersection of Technical Services with Production Sharing Contracts

**Technical services** in the context of **Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs)** create complex interactions between service arrangements, cost recovery mechanisms, and fiscal obligations. Understanding these interactions is critical for structuring efficient operations while ensuring compliance with PSC terms and applicable tax laws.

**Key Issues at the PSC-Technical Services Interface:**

1. **Cost recovery eligibility**: Whether technical service costs qualify as "petroleum operations" costs
2. **Affiliate service rules**: Treatment of intra-group services under PSC cost recovery provisions
3. **Service fee characterization**: Whether fees constitute recoverable costs or profit oil adjustments
4. **Permanent establishment exposure**: Whether service provision creates PE for contractor or service provider
5. **Withholding tax obligations**: Application of WHT to service fees under PSC fiscal regime
6. **Transfer pricing scrutiny**: Arm's length pricing of technical services between affiliates

### 1.2 Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) - Structure and Purpose

A **Joint Operating Agreement (JOA)** is the contractual framework governing the relationship between working interest owners (co-venturers) in an oil and gas project. JOAs are distinct from PSCs but often operate alongside them.

**Fundamental JOA Characteristics:**

- **Unincorporated joint venture**: Participants remain separate legal entities
- **Operator appointment**: One party (typically with largest interest) designated as operator
- **Cost sharing**: Expenses allocated pro rata to working interest percentages
- **Joint account**: Non-operator contributions flow through joint account mechanism
- **Non-recourse structure**: Each party liable only for its proportionate share

**Standard JOA Models:**

- **Association of International Petroleum Negotiators (AIPN) Model Form JOA** - International projects
- **American Association of Professional Landmen (AAPL) Form 610 JOA** - US onshore
- **Canadian Association of Petroleum Landmen (CAPL) Operating Procedure** - Canada
- **North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) Model JOA** - **United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS)** operations

### 1.3 Technical Services Delivery Models Under PSC/JOA Structures

**Policy rationale**: PSC affiliate service limitations prevent profit shifting through inflated intercompany service charges, ensuring host governments receive fair value from their natural resources. These provisions balance contractor operational flexibility with government revenue protection, reflecting the fundamental tension in resource fiscal regimes between encouraging investment and maximizing national benefit.

**Model 1: Operator as Service Provider**

The **operator** provides technical services to the joint venture under the JOA. Services may include:
- Reservoir engineering and subsurface studies
- Drilling engineering and supervision
- Facilities engineering and operations support
- Procurement and contracting services

**Tax Considerations:**
- Operator typically provides services "at cost" under JOA terms
- No profit margin recognized (cost pass-through model)
- Transfer pricing challenges if operator is non-resident affiliate
- Potential PE creation if operator is non-resident entity

**Model 2: Third-Party Service Providers**

External specialized firms contracted directly by:
- **The Operator** on behalf of joint venture (most common)
- **Individual Working Interest Owners** for their specific needs
- **The Consortium** collectively under separate service agreements

**Tax Considerations:**
- Services recoverable under PSC if qualifying "petroleum costs"
- WHT typically applies to cross-border service payments
- Treaty relief may be available depending on service characterization
- PE exposure depends on service duration and nature

**Model 3: Affiliate Service Company**

A **group service company** provides technical services to **Production Sharing Contract (PSC)** contractor (affiliate):
- Centralized technical expertise within corporate group
- Services provided on cost-plus or market pricing basis
- Common for seismic processing, reservoir engineering, drilling engineering

**Tax Considerations:**
- Cost recovery eligibility under PSC affiliate service provisions
- Mark-ups often subject to PSC contractual limits (e.g., 5-10% maximum)
- Transfer pricing documentation requirements
- Potential WHT and PE exposure in host country

## 2. Technical Rules: PSC Cost Recovery and Service Fee Treatment

### 2.1 Cost Recovery Mechanics Under PSCs

**Cost Recovery Ceiling:**

Most PSCs impose a **cost recovery ceiling** limiting the percentage of gross production available for cost recovery:

| Jurisdiction | Cost Recovery Limit | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Indonesia** | 100% (pre-2017); Variable (post-2017 Gross Split) | Gross Split PSCs have no cost recovery |
| **Malaysia** | 100% (with carryforward) | Excess costs carried forward with interest |
| **Angola** | 50% of gross production | Unrecovered costs rolled forward |
| **Iraq** | Per-barrel remuneration fee | Service contract model, not cost recovery |
| **Ghana** | 60-75% depending on water depth | Higher limits for deepwater |
| **Egypt** | 40-45% typical | Varies by licensing round |

**Cost Recovery Categories:**

**Recoverable Costs** (typically):
- Exploration costs (seismic, drilling, geological studies)
- Development costs (production facilities, infrastructure)
- Operating costs (production operations, maintenance)
- **Technical services directly related to petroleum operations**
- Abandonment and decommissioning costs

**Non-Recoverable Costs** (typically):
- Corporate overhead not directly related to operations
- Financing costs (interest) - often excluded or limited
- Costs incurred prior to PSC effective date (pre-contract costs)
- **Affiliate service fees exceeding arm's length pricing**
- Penalties, fines, and non-compliance costs

### 2.2 Affiliate Service Provisions in PSCs

Most modern PSCs contain **specific provisions governing affiliate services** to prevent abuse and ensure arm's length pricing.

**Typical PSC Affiliate Service Clauses:**

**Example - Angola PSC Model (2018):**

> *"Costs incurred for goods and services provided by an affiliate of the Contractor shall be the lower of: (a) actual cost to the affiliate plus a mark-up not exceeding 5%; or (b) the market price for comparable goods or services in the location where the operations are conducted."*

**Example - Indonesia Gross Split PSC (2017):**

Gross Split PSCs eliminate cost recovery entirely. Contractors receive a percentage of gross production with adjustments for:
- Variable split factors (location, reservoir depth, infrastructure)
- Progressive split (production volume triggers)
- Contractors bear all costs from their production share

**Tax Implications:**
- No cost recovery = no affiliate service cost scrutiny
- Transfer pricing still relevant for corporate tax purposes
- Simplified fiscal administration

**Example - Ghana Model PSC (2016):**

> *"Where the Contractor proposes to utilize services of an Affiliate, the cost shall not exceed the lower of (i) cost plus 7.5% mark-up, or (ii) the market price that would be charged by a non-affiliated third party for comparable services under comparable circumstances."*

### 2.3 Transfer Pricing in PSC Cost Recovery

**Dual Review Framework:**

Technical service fees paid to affiliates face **two levels of review**:

1. **PSC Contractual Compliance**: Does service fee comply with PSC affiliate provisions?
2. **Tax Transfer Pricing Rules**: Does service fee satisfy arm's length standard under domestic law and OECD Guidelines?

**Potential Disallowance Scenarios:**

- **Scenario A**: Service fee is $1,000,000; PSC allows cost + 5%; affiliate's actual cost is $800,000
  - **PSC recoverable amount**: $800,000 × 1.05 = $840,000
  - **Disallowed for cost recovery**: $160,000

- **Scenario B**: Service fee is $1,000,000; comparable third-party market price is $850,000
  - **Transfer pricing adjustment**: $150,000 may be challenged
  - **Cost recovery impact**: Depends on whether government or contractor bears the adjustment

**Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Methods for Technical Services:**

1. **Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP)**: Compare to third-party service rates
2. **Cost Plus Method**: Actual costs plus appropriate mark-up (most common for technical services)
3. **Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)**: Operating margin benchmarking

**Industry Practice:**
- Cost-plus mark-ups of **5-15%** are typically defensible for routine technical services
- Specialized high-value services may justify **15-25%** mark-ups
- Documentation critical: contemporaneous transfer pricing studies required

## 3. Application Methodology: Worked Examples

### Example 1: Operator Technical Services Under JOA/PSC Structure

**Fact Pattern:**

**Participants in Nigerian Offshore Block:**
- **ShellEx Nigeria Limited** (Operator, 40% working interest, Nigerian subsidiary of Shell)
- **TotalCO Nigeria** (30% working interest, Nigerian subsidiary of TotalEnergies)
- **NNPC** (National Oil Company, 30% working interest)

**Joint Operating Agreement:**
- AIPN Model Form JOA governs relationship
- ShellEx acts as operator
- Operator provides technical services "at cost" under JOA Section 5.3

**Technical Services Provided by Operator (Year 1):**
- Reservoir engineering studies: $2,000,000
- Drilling engineering supervision: $5,000,000
- Facilities operations support: $3,000,000
- **Total technical services**: $10,000,000

**PSC Terms (Nigeria Model PSC 2021):**
- Cost recovery ceiling: 80% of gross production value
- Royalty: 10% of gross production
- Profit oil split: Government 60% / Contractor 40%
- Income tax: **Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT)** at 30% (for operator/contractors)

**Question:** How are operator technical service costs treated for cost recovery and tax purposes?

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: JOA Cost Allocation**

Under the JOA, operator costs are allocated to non-operators:
- ShellEx (40%): $4,000,000
- TotalCO (30%): $3,000,000
- NNPC (30%): $3,000,000

**Step 2: PSC Cost Recovery Eligibility**

**Are operator technical services recoverable costs?**
- **Yes**: Section 8.1 of Nigeria PSC defines "petroleum operations costs" to include "all expenditures necessary or appropriate for carrying out petroleum operations"
- Reservoir engineering, drilling supervision, and facilities support are directly related to petroleum operations
- **Conclusion**: $10,000,000 is fully recoverable (subject to 80% cost recovery ceiling)

**Step 3: Transfer Pricing Considerations**

**Issue**: ShellEx (operator) is providing services to TotalCO and NNPC. Is this an arm's length transaction?

**JOA Protection**:
- JOA Section 5.3 specifies services provided "at cost" with no mark-up
- This is standard industry practice under JOAs
- **OECD Transfer Pricing (TP) Guidelines**: Cost-sharing arrangements under JOAs typically satisfy arm's length standard if:
  - Costs are allocated based on reasonable formula (working interest %)
  - Participants benefit from services in proportion to allocation
  - No profit element included

**Conclusion**: At-cost operator charges under JOA are arm's length compliant.

**Step 4: Withholding Tax Implications**

**Issue**: Do cash calls from NNPC and TotalCO to operator constitute service payments subject to WHT?

**Nigeria Tax Analysis**:
- **Section 13 of Companies Income Tax Act (CITA)**: **Withholding tax (WHT)** at 10% applies to "payments for services"
- **Industry Practice**: Operator cash calls under JOAs are typically **not** treated as service payments for WHT purposes
  - Operator acts as agent for joint venture
  - Participants are reimbursing their share of joint costs
  - No profit element (at-cost reimbursement)

**FIRS Guidance** (Federal Inland Revenue Service Practice Note 2019):
- WHT does not apply to "pure cost reimbursements" under JOAs where operator receives no margin

**Conclusion**: No WHT on operator cash calls under Nigerian JOA practice.

**Step 5: Income Tax Treatment**

**For ShellEx (Operator)**:
- Revenue from joint venture operations (its 40% share)
- Deductible costs: its 40% share of joint account costs ($4,000,000)
- **No profit/loss** on provision of operator services (at-cost model)

**For TotalCO and NNPC**:
- Revenue from joint venture operations (30% each)
- Deductible costs: 30% each of joint account costs ($3,000,000 each)

**Key Point**: Operator services provided at cost create **no incremental tax liability** for operator.

### Example 2: Affiliate Technical Service Company - PSC Cost Recovery Limitation

**Fact Pattern:**

**Parties:**
- **BPEx Angola Limitada** (BP affiliate, PSC contractor in Angola Block 18)
- **BP Technical Services Limited** (UK resident, group technical services entity)

**Service Arrangement:**
- BP Technical Services provides specialized reservoir engineering services
- Services critical for **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)** project
- **Service fee structure**: Cost-plus 12% mark-up

**Year 1 Service Delivery:**
- **Direct costs incurred by BP Technical Services**: $8,000,000
  - Personnel costs: $5,000,000
  - Technology and software: $2,000,000
  - Travel and subsistence: $1,000,000
- **Mark-up (12%)**: $960,000
- **Total invoice**: $8,960,000

**Angola PSC Terms (Block 18 PSC):**
- **Affiliate service provision**: *"Costs for services from Contractor affiliates shall be the lower of (a) cost plus 5% mark-up, or (b) market price for comparable services"*
- **Cost recovery ceiling**: 50% of gross production value
- **Profit oil split**: Sonangol 60% / Contractor 40%
- **Income tax**: 50% on contractor's profit oil (fully creditable)

**Angola-UK Tax Treaty:**
- Dividends: 5% WHT (qualifying subsidiary)
- Interest: 10% WHT
- Royalties: 10% WHT
- **Technical services**: No specific article (default to Article 7 - Business Profits)

**Questions:**
1. How much of the $8,960,000 service fee is recoverable under the PSC?
2. What is the Angola WHT treatment of the service payment?
3. What is the UK tax treatment for BP Technical Services?

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: PSC Cost Recovery - Affiliate Limitation**

**PSC Limit**: Cost + 5% = $8,000,000 × 1.05 = **$8,400,000**

**Invoice Amount**: $8,960,000

**Disallowed amount**: $8,960,000 - $8,400,000 = **$560,000**

**Cost Recovery:**
- **Recoverable**: $8,400,000 (subject to 50% cost recovery ceiling and availability)
- **Non-recoverable**: $560,000

**Who bears the disallowed cost?**
- **BPEx Angola** bears the economic burden
- The $560,000 is not recoverable from government cost oil
- BPEx must fund this from its profit oil share

**Impact on Government Take:**
- Government benefits from the disallowance
- Less cost recovery = more profit oil = higher government share

**Step 2: Benchmarking Analysis - Market Price Comparison**

**PSC Alternative**: If market price for comparable services is lower than cost-plus 5%, market price applies.

**Comparability Search:**
- Comparable independent reservoir engineering firms: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Weatherford
- Market rates for EOR reservoir engineering services in Angola: $8,200,000 - $9,500,000 (based on industry benchmarks)

**Conclusion**:
- Cost-plus 5% ($8,400,000) < Market price ($8,200,000 - $9,500,000)
- **Cost-plus 5% applies** ($8,400,000 recoverable)

**Alternative Scenario**: If market price were $8,000,000:
- Market price < Cost-plus 5%
- **Market price would apply** ($8,000,000 recoverable)
- Additional $400,000 would be non-recoverable

**Step 3: Angola Withholding Tax on Service Payments**

**Angola Domestic Law:**
- **Industrial Services WHT** (Imposto sobre o Rendimento do Trabalho): 6.5% on technical services
- Applies to payments to non-resident service providers

**Treaty Analysis (Angola-UK Tax Treaty):**

**Article 7 (Business Profits)**:
- Profits taxable only in residence state unless PE exists in source state
- **PE threshold**: Article 5 - fixed place of business or service PE (183 days in 12 months)

**Service PE (Article 5(3)(b) - UN Model influence):**
- Services provided for more than 183 days in any 12-month period create PE

**Fact Pattern Application:**
- BP Technical Services personnel **not** present in Angola for 183+ days
- Services provided remotely from UK (reservoir simulation, engineering studies)
- Limited Angola presence (short visits for data collection)

**Conclusion**:
- **No PE in Angola** (no fixed place, no service PE)
- **Treaty protection**: Article 7 prevents Angola source taxation
- **Angola WHT**: Not applicable under treaty (treaty overrides domestic law)

**Result**: $8,960,000 paid by BPEx Angola to BP Technical Services **without Angola WHT**

**Caveat**: Angola tax authorities may require:
- Certificate of UK tax residency
- Documentation proving services performed outside Angola
- Evidence of no PE (personnel time records)

**Step 4: UK Tax Treatment**

**BP Technical Services Limited (UK)**:

**Taxable Income:**
- Service revenue: $8,960,000
- Less: Direct costs: ($8,000,000)
- **Taxable profit**: $960,000

**UK Corporate Tax:**
- Rate: 25% (2024 onwards for profits > £250,000)
- Tax liability: $960,000 × 25% = **$240,000**

**Foreign Tax Credit:**
- No Angola WHT paid (treaty protection)
- No foreign tax credit available

**Transfer Pricing Risk:**

**HMRC Review**: Is 12% mark-up arm's length?

**Benchmarking Analysis**:
- Industry standard for routine technical services: 5-10% mark-up
- Specialized high-value services (EOR reservoir engineering): 10-20% mark-up
- BP Technical Services provides **specialized EOR expertise**

**Conclusion**: 12% mark-up likely defensible if:
- Contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation exists
- Functional analysis demonstrates specialized nature
- Comparables support 10-20% range for EOR services

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)**: BP could seek UK-Angola bilateral APA
- **Transfer pricing documentation**: TP Local File and Master File per OECD BEPS Action 13

**Step 5: Economic Impact Summary**

| Stakeholder | Economic Impact |
|-------------|----------------|
| **BP Technical Services (UK)** | Revenue $8,960,000; Profit $960,000; UK tax $240,000; Net profit $720,000 |
| **BPEx Angola** | Cost $8,960,000; PSC recoverable $8,400,000; Non-recoverable $560,000 |
| **Angola Government** | Benefits from $560,000 disallowance (increased profit oil share) |
| **UK Government** | Receives $240,000 corporate tax; No Angola tax credit utilization |

**Key Insight**: PSC affiliate limitation creates economic inefficiency
- BP Group incurs $8,960,000 cost
- Only $8,400,000 recoverable
- $560,000 effective "tax" due to PSC limitation (not actual tax, but non-recoverable cost)

### Example 3: Technical Services Under Indonesian Gross Split PSC

**Fact Pattern:**

**Parties:**
- **Pertamina Hulu Energi (PHE)** - Indonesian state-owned operator
- **Chevron Indonesia** - PSC contractor (60% working interest)
- **CNOOC SES** - PSC contractor (40% working interest)

**PSC Type:**
- **Indonesian Gross Split PSC (2017 Regulation)**
- Contractor receives gross production split (no cost recovery mechanism)
- Base split: Contractor 57% / Government 43%
- Adjustments for: location, reservoir depth, production stage, local content, etc.

**Technical Services Arrangement:**
- PHE (operator) engages **Schlumberger Asia Services** (Singapore) for integrated drilling services
- **Service scope**: Directional drilling, logging while drilling (LWD), measurement while drilling (MWD)
- **Contract value**: $25,000,000 for 5-well campaign
- **Service duration**: 18 months (continuous presence)

**Indonesia-Singapore Tax Treaty:**
- Business profits: Article 7 (taxable only if PE)
- **Service PE**: Article 5(3) - services exceeding 120 days in 12 months create PE
- Technical services: No specific article (default Article 7)

**Indonesia Domestic Tax Law:**
- **WHT on technical services**: 20% (domestic rate)
- **Treaty rate**: 0% if no PE (Article 7 protection)
- **Branch profits tax**: 20% (if PE established)

**Questions:**
1. Does Schlumberger have a PE in Indonesia?
2. What is the WHT treatment?
3. How does Gross Split PSC affect cost recovery?

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: PE Determination**

**Service PE Test (Article 5(3) Indonesia-Singapore Treaty):**
- Threshold: Services performed **for more than 120 days** in any 12-month period

**Fact Application:**
- Schlumberger personnel present on drilling rigs (Indonesian waters) for **18 months continuously**
- Total days: 540+ days (18 months × 30 days)
- **540 days >> 120 days threshold**

**Conclusion**: **Service PE created** under Article 5(3)

**Step 2: Tax Consequences of PE**

**Corporate Income Tax (CIT):**
- Schlumberger subject to **Indonesian corporate tax** on profits attributable to Indonesian **Permanent Establishment (PE)**
- Rate: **22%** (2024 onwards)
- Tax base: Revenue minus allowable expenses
- **Profit attribution**: OECD **Authorised OECD Approach (AOA)** - PE treated as separate enterprise

**Withholding Tax:**
- **No WHT** on service payments (WHT not applicable once PE established)
- PE files corporate tax return and pays tax on profits
- **Branch Profits Tax**: 20% on after-tax profits remitted to head office (applies to PEs)

**Step 3: Gross Split PSC - No Cost Recovery Impact**

**Critical Distinction:**
- Under **traditional cost recovery PSC**, contractor would recover $25M service cost from cost oil
- Under **Gross Split PSC**, there is **no cost recovery mechanism**

**Impact:**
- Chevron Indonesia (60%) bears $15,000,000 of drilling service cost
- CNOOC SES (40%) bears $10,000,000 of drilling service cost
- Costs paid from contractors' production share (57% base split)

**No Government Scrutiny of Affiliate Services:**
- Government receives its 43% split regardless of contractor costs
- Contractors have full commercial freedom to engage service providers at any price
- **No PSC affiliate limitations apply** (since no cost recovery exists)

**Transfer Pricing Still Relevant:**
- If Schlumberger were an affiliate of Chevron or CNOOC, Indonesia tax authorities could challenge pricing under **transfer pricing rules** (not PSC terms)
- Affects contractors' **Indonesian corporate tax** liability on their operations
- Government's production share unaffected

**Step 4: Comparison - Cost Recovery PSC vs. Gross Split PSC**

| Feature | Traditional PSC | Gross Split PSC (Indonesia) |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Cost recovery** | Yes (with ceiling, e.g., 80%) | No cost recovery |
| **Affiliate service limits** | Yes (e.g., cost + 5%) | No (PSC terms don't govern costs) |
| **Government scrutiny** | High (cost recovery audit) | Low (no cost recovery to audit) |
| **Contractor risk** | Lower (costs recovered) | Higher (all costs from production share) |
| **Fiscal administration** | Complex (cost audits) | Simple (production split only) |
| **Transfer pricing relevance** | High (cost recovery eligibility) | Moderate (tax purposes only) |

**Step 5: Tax Compliance for Schlumberger PE**

**Indonesian Tax Filings:**
1. **PE Registration**: Register PE with **Direktorat Jenderal Pajak (DGP)** (Indonesian Tax Directorate General)
2. **Monthly WHT Returns**: File Formulir 1721 (though no WHT in PE scenario)
3. **Annual Corporate Tax Return**: File **SPT Tahunan** (Annual Tax Return) reporting PE profits
4. **Transfer Pricing Documentation**: If related-party transactions exist
5. **Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR)**: If Schlumberger group revenue > €750M

**Tax Calculation Example:**

**Assumed Profit Margin**: 15% on $25M revenue

| Item | Amount (USD) |
|------|--------------|
| Revenue from drilling services | $25,000,000 |
| Less: Costs (personnel, equipment, etc.) | ($21,250,000) |
| **PE Taxable Profit** | **$3,750,000** |
| Indonesian CIT (22%) | ($825,000) |
| **After-tax profit** | **$2,925,000** |
| Branch Profits Tax (20%) | ($585,000) |
| **Net remittable to head office** | **$2,340,000** |

**Effective Tax Rate**: ($825,000 + $585,000) / $25,000,000 = **5.64%** of revenue
or **37.6%** of pre-tax profit

**Comparison if No PE (Treaty Protection):**
- No Indonesian tax (Article 7 protection)
- Profits taxed only in Singapore (17% rate)
- Singapore tax: $3,750,000 × 17% = $637,500
- **Net profit**: $3,112,500

**PE creates additional tax burden**: $1,410,000 - $637,500 = **$772,500 extra tax**

## 4. Recent Developments (2023-2025)

### 4.1 OECD BEPS and PSC Cost Recovery

**BEPS Actions Impacting PSC Operations:**

**Action 4 - Interest Limitations:**
- Many PSCs historically excluded financing costs from cost recovery
- **Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)** Action 4 recommends 30% **Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)** limit on interest deductions
- **Impact**: Minimal for PSC cost recovery (already restricted), but affects contractors' corporate tax computations

**Action 13 - Transfer Pricing Documentation:**
- Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) now mandatory for large MNEs
- **Master File and Local File** requirements apply to technical service arrangements
- Host governments increasingly demand TP documentation for cost recovery claims

**Case Study - Ghana Revenue Authority (2024)**:
- GRA disallowed $12M in affiliate service costs for lack of contemporaneous TP documentation
- Contractor required to provide benchmarking study demonstrating arm's length pricing

### 4.2 Digitalization and Technical Services Classification

**Digital Services Creating Classification Issues:**

**Example - Cloud-Based Reservoir Simulation:**
- Service provider hosts reservoir simulation software in cloud
- Contractor accesses via **Software as a Service (SaaS)** model
- **Question**: Is this a technical service or a royalty (software license)?

**Tax Treaty Implications:**
- **If Technical Service** (Article 7): Taxable only if PE exists
- **If Royalty** (Article 12): Source-country WHT applies (10-20% typical)

**OECD Guidance (2024 Commentary Update)**:
- SaaS generally treated as **service** (not royalty) if:
  - Customer does not acquire intellectual property rights
  - Access is temporary and non-exclusive
  - Payment is for access/use, not for **Intellectual Property (IP)** itself

**Practical Impact**: Cloud-based technical services maintain Article 7 treatment (favorable for service providers)

**Policy rationale**: SaaS classification as service (not royalty) reflects modern digital business models where value derives from ongoing service delivery rather than IP transfer, preventing inappropriate source taxation that would inhibit cloud technology adoption in energy operations.

### 4.3 Energy Transition and New Technical Services

**Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Services:**
- New technical services emerging: CO2 injection engineering, reservoir monitoring for **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**
- **PSC treatment unclear**: Are CCS costs "petroleum operations" costs?

**Example - Norway Longship CCS Project (2024)**:
- Equinor provides CCS technical services under JOA-like structure
- **Norwegian Tax Authority** ruling: CCS services qualify for petroleum tax regime if integrated with production operations

**Renewable Energy Integration:**
- Platform electrification using offshore wind
- **Technical services**: Wind turbine engineering, grid integration studies
- **PSC issue**: Traditional PSCs cover only "petroleum operations" - amendments needed for electrification costs

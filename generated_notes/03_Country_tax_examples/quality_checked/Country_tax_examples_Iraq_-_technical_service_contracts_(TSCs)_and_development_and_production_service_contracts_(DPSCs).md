## 1. Core Framework of Iraq Petroleum Fiscal Regime

### 1.1 Introduction and Statutory Basis

Iraq's petroleum fiscal regime represents one of the most distinctive service contract models globally, characterized by **state retention of full ownership** over hydrocarbon resources while international oil companies (IOCs) act as **service providers** rather than production sharers or concessionaires. This structure emerged from Iraq's constitutional framework (Article 111 of the 2005 Constitution, ratified by referendum on 15 October 2005) which vests ownership of oil and gas in "all the people of Iraq," reflecting the principle of collective national ownership over natural resources.

The legal foundation comprises:
- **Iraqi Constitution of 2005** (Article 111 on oil and gas ownership; Article 112 requiring federal oil and gas law)
- **Federal Petroleum Law** (various drafts since 2007, not yet enacted; ongoing negotiations between Baghdad and Kurdistan Regional Government)
- **Federal Budget Law** (annual authorizations for oil contracts and Ministry of Oil expenditures)
- **Model Contract Templates** (2009 onwards for TSC/DPSC bid rounds, establishing standardized fiscal terms)
- **Income Tax Law No. 113 of 1982** (as amended, establishing 15% general corporate tax rate)
- **Oil and Gas Tax Law No. 19 of 2010** (establishing 35% corporate tax rate specifically for oil and gas sector)
- **Investment Law No. 13 of 2006** (providing tax incentives including 10-15 year tax exemptions for licensed projects)

### 1.2 TSC vs. DPSC Structure

**Technical Service Contracts (TSCs)**: Applied to fields requiring **exploration and appraisal** followed by development. The contractor bears exploration risk and receives remuneration only upon commercial production. TSCs were utilized in Iraq's Fourth Bid Round (2012) for exploration blocks. The TSC structure compensates contractors for the additional exploration risk through potential for higher remuneration fees if discoveries are made.

**Development and Production Service Contracts (DPSCs)**: Applied to **proven developed fields** with existing infrastructure and known reserves. The contractor focuses on production optimization, enhanced oil recovery techniques, plateau maintenance, and infrastructure rehabilitation. DPSCs were the primary vehicle in Iraq's 2009-2010 bid rounds covering super-giant fields including Rumaila, West Qurna, Zubair, and Majnoon.

**Key Distinction**: DPSCs involve **no exploration risk** as they apply to fields with certified proven and probable reserves, whereas TSCs require contractors to fund exploration activities with cost recovery contingent on commercial discovery and production.

| **Feature** | **TSC** | **DPSC** |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Application** | Exploration blocks | Proven/developed fields |
| **Contractor Risk** | High (exploration risk) | Moderate (production/operational risk) |
| **Reserve Certainty** | Uncertain (exploration phase) | Proven/probable reserves certified |
| **Contract Duration** | 20-25 years typical | 20 years typical |
| **Example Fields** | Fourth Round blocks (Akkas gas field) | Rumaila, West Qurna-1, West Qurna-2, Zubair, Majnoon |

### 1.3 Service Fee Model (Not PSC)

Critically, Iraqi contracts are **not Production Sharing Contracts**. Contractors do not receive a share of production or "profit oil/gas" entitlement. Instead, remuneration is structured as:
- **Per-barrel fee** ($/bbl) paid in cash (or occasionally oil equivalent at government discretion)
- **Cost recovery** for approved capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX)
- **No equity in reserves** or production entitlement beyond contractual service fees

This structure preserves state ownership throughout the petroleum value chain, distinguishing Iraq's federal regime from PSC regimes in Kurdistan Region, Angola, Indonesia, or Brazil. The service fee model reflects Iraq's constitutional requirement for state ownership and its preference for maintaining direct control over hydrocarbon resources rather than sharing production entitlements.

## 2. Technical Rules: Remuneration and Tax Treatment

### 2.1 Remuneration Fee Structure

Iraq's remuneration fees are structured as **$/barrel fees** tied to incremental production above baseline levels. The fee structure is typically **tiered**, with rates adjusting based on plateau production achievement and field performance:

**Standard Structure:**
- **Plateau Production Target**: Contractually specified target production level (e.g., 2,850,000 bpd for Rumaila)
- **Remuneration Fee**: Fixed $/bbl rate determined through competitive bidding (lowest fee wins)
- **Tiered Adjustments**: Fees may reduce if production significantly exceeds plateau targets or increase for enhanced recovery investment requirements

**Major Field Examples (2009-2012 Bid Rounds):**

| **Field** | **Operator** | **Remuneration Fee ($/bbl)** | **Plateau Target (bpd)** | **Contract Type** |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Rumaila | BP/PetroChina | $2.00 (bid down from $3.99) | 2,850,000 | DPSC |
| West Qurna-1 | ExxonMobil/Shell | $1.90 | 2,325,000 | DPSC |
| West Qurna-2 | Lukoil/Statoil | $1.15 | 1,800,000 | DPSC |
| Zubair | ENI/Occidental/KOGAS | $2.00 | 1,200,000 | DPSC |
| Majnoon | Shell/Petronas | $1.39 | 1,800,000 | DPSC |

**Fee Negotiation Dynamics**: Iraq's bidding process requires IOCs to bid competitively on remuneration fees, with the lowest fee bidder (subject to meeting technical and financial qualifications) winning the contract award. Initial bid rounds in 2009 saw significant fee reductions during negotiations; for example, BP's Rumaila bid was reduced from $3.99 per barrel to $2.00 per barrel. The resulting low fees ($1.15 to $2.30 per barrel for major DPSCs) necessitate very large-scale operations to achieve commercial returns for contractors.

### 2.2 Cost Recovery Mechanism

Contractors recover **approved costs** from a designated portion of production revenues:
- **Cost Recovery Limit (Existing Contracts)**: Capped at **50% of annual field production value** (total service fees including both cost recovery and remuneration fees combined)
- **Cost Recovery Limit (Newer Contracts - Bid Round 5)**: Raised to **65-70% of production value** for exploration blocks and gas fields to incentivize investment
- **Recoverable Costs**: Approved CAPEX, OPEX, and financing costs subject to government approval and audit
- **Carry-forward**: Unrecovered costs carried forward with interest (typically LIBOR-based rates or successor reference rates)
- **Audit Requirements**: Annual cost audits by Iraqi authorities to verify eligible costs

**Non-Recoverable Costs**: Income taxes, penalties, costs exceeding approved budgets without authorization, and certain general and administrative allocations above specified thresholds are not recoverable.

### 2.3 Tax Treatment

**Corporate Income Tax - Oil and Gas Sector**: **35% federal rate** under **Oil and Gas Tax Law No. 19 of 2010**, which applies specifically to income from contracts concluded with foreign oil companies, their branches or offices, and subcontractors working in Iraq in the oil and gas production sector and related industries. The tax base is **gross remuneration fee minus allowable deductions** (primarily depreciation and financing charges, but not operating costs already recovered through cost recovery).

**Corporate Income Tax - General**: 15% federal rate under Income Tax Law No. 113 of 1982 (as amended) applies to non-petroleum business activities.

**Withholding Taxes**: **15% WHT** applies to:
- Service payments to non-resident subcontractors
- Interest payments to foreign lenders
- Royalty and technical service payments

**Tax Stabilization and Investment Incentives**: Investment Law No. 13 of 2006 provides tax exemptions for 10-15 years for projects holding investment licenses from the National Investment Commission. Some DPSCs include tax stabilization clauses negotiated in contract terms, though the 35% federal rate for oil and gas activities remains the standard statutory rate. The interaction between Investment Law exemptions and Oil and Gas Tax Law requirements may be subject to contractual negotiation and government discretion.

**Depreciation**: Accelerated depreciation often permitted for petroleum assets (e.g., 33% declining balance method for upstream equipment and infrastructure).

## 3. Kurdistan Region Differences

The **Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)** operates a separate petroleum framework under **Production Sharing Contracts**, not TSCs/DPSCs:

**Legal Framework:**
- **KRG Oil & Gas Law No. 22 of 6 August 2007**: Establishes PSC-based regime for Kurdistan Region
- **Corporate Tax Rate**: Variable (often negotiated at 20-30% in PSC terms)
- **Production Sharing**: Contractors receive profit oil shares (typically 15-25% contractor share after cost recovery)
- **Royalty**: Standard 10% royalty on gross production
- **Cost Recovery Ceiling**: Up to 40% of production value for cost recovery in KRG PSCs

**Constitutional Disputes**: The federal government in Baghdad disputes KRG authority to sign independent petroleum contracts, asserting that the KRG Oil & Gas Law and all PSCs entered into by the KRG are unconstitutional under Articles 111-112 of the Iraqi Constitution. Iraq's Supreme Court ruled in February 2022 that KRG production sharing contracts are unconstitutional, creating legal uncertainty for international oil companies operating under KRG PSCs. The dispute centers on whether the KRG has authority to manage petroleum resources independently or whether such authority resides exclusively with the federal government pending enactment of a federal petroleum law.

**Transfer Pricing Considerations**: Transactions between KRG and federal Iraq, or between contractor affiliates, face scrutiny under Iraqi transfer pricing regulations based on OECD guidelines to ensure arm's length pricing.

## 4. Application Methodology: Iraqi DPSC Calculation Framework

**Step 1**: Determine **gross production** and **incremental production** above contractually defined baseline production levels.

**Step 2**: Calculate **cost recovery** amount (capped at 50% of production value for existing contracts, or 65-70% for newer contracts under Bid Round 5).

**Step 3**: Calculate **remuneration fee**: Incremental production (barrels) × $/bbl fee rate.

**Step 4**: Calculate **corporate income tax** (35% under Oil and Gas Tax Law No. 19/2010) on remuneration fee minus allowable deductions (depreciation, financing costs).

**Step 5**: Apply **withholding taxes** (15%) on applicable payments to non-residents.

**Step 6**: Determine **net contractor take** after all taxes and cost recovery.

## 5. Worked Example: Iraqi DPSC Calculation

**Scenario**: West Qurna Field DPSC

**Assumptions**:
- Remuneration fee: **$1.50/bbl**
- Annual production: **200 million barrels**
- Baseline production: **50 million barrels**
- Incremental production: **150 million barrels**
- Oil price: **$80/bbl**
- Annual CAPEX: **$1.2 billion**
- Annual OPEX: **$800 million**
- Total service fee limit (cost recovery + remuneration): **50% of production value**
- Corporate income tax rate: **35%** (Oil and Gas Tax Law No. 19/2010)
- Depreciation: **$300 million** (allowed tax deduction)

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Production Value**
```
Gross production value = 200 million bbls × $80/bbl = $16,000 million
```

**Step 2: Calculate Total Service Fee Limit**
```
Total service fee limit = 50% × $16,000m = $8,000 million
```

**Step 3: Calculate Cost Recovery**
```
Total costs = CAPEX + OPEX = $1,200m + $800m = $2,000 million
```

**Step 4: Calculate Remuneration Fee**
```
Remuneration fee = Incremental production × $/bbl fee
= 150 million bbls × $1.50/bbl = $225 million
```

**Step 5: Verify Total Service Fee**
```
Total service fee = Cost recovery + Remuneration fee
= $2,000m + $225m = $2,225 million

Check against limit: $2,225m < $8,000m ✓ (within 50% cap)
```

**Step 6: Calculate Corporate Income Tax**
```
Taxable income = Remuneration fee - Depreciation
= $225m - $300m = -$75 million (tax loss)
Tax payable = 35% × $0 (loss carried forward) = $0
```

**Alternative Scenario (Assuming Depreciation Already Taken)**:
```
Taxable income = $225 million
Corporate income tax = 35% × $225m = $78.75 million
```

**Step 7: Calculate Net Contractor Take (Assuming Tax Applies)**
```
Net contractor revenue = Cost recovery + Remuneration fee - Corporate income tax
= $2,000m + $225m - $78.75m = $2,146.25 million
```

**Step 8: Calculate Government Take**
```
Government gross revenue = (Production value - Cost recovery - Remuneration fee) + Tax
= ($16,000m - $2,000m - $225m) + $78.75m = $13,853.75 million
```

**Government Take Percentage** = $13,853.75m / $16,000m = **86.6%**
**Contractor Take Percentage** = $2,146.25m / $16,000m = **13.4%**

**Summary Table:**

| Item | Amount ($ million) | Percentage of Gross Revenue |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Gross Production Value | 16,000.0 | 100.0% |
| Cost Recovery (Contractor) | (2,000.0) | (12.5%) |
| Remuneration Fee (Contractor) | (225.0) | (1.4%) |
| Corporate Income Tax (35%) | (78.8) | (0.5%) |
| **Net Contractor Cash** | **2,146.3** | **13.4%** |
| **Total Government Take** | **13,853.8** | **86.6%** |

**Key Observations**:
- The service fee model results in **very high government take** (typically 85-90% of gross revenues)
- Contractors face **limited upside** from oil price increases due to fixed $/bbl fee structure
- **Cost recovery certainty** is critical to contractor economics; delays or disputes over cost eligibility significantly impact returns
- **Low remuneration fees** ($1.15-$2.30/bbl historically) necessitate large-scale operations (multi-hundred million barrel annual production) for commercial viability
- **35% corporate tax rate** on remuneration fees (not the 15% general rate) applies to oil and gas contractors under Law No. 19/2010

**Study Note Key Points:**

1. Iraqi TSCs/DPSCs are **service fee contracts**, not PSCs, preserving full state ownership under Article 111 of 2005 Constitution
2. **Two contract types**: TSCs for exploration blocks (higher risk, contractor bears exploration costs); DPSCs for proven fields (lower risk, focus on production optimization)
3. **Remuneration fees** are competitively bid and typically low ($1.15-$2.30/bbl for major fields awarded 2009-2012)
4. **Corporate income tax**: **35% federal rate** for oil and gas sector under Oil and Gas Tax Law No. 19 of 2010 (NOT the 15% general rate)
5. **Cost recovery limit**: 50% of production value for total service fees (cost recovery + remuneration combined) in existing contracts; raised to 65-70% in newer Bid Round 5 contracts
6. **Withholding taxes**: 15% on payments to non-resident subcontractors, interest, and technical services
7. **Government take** exceeds 85-90% of gross revenues, reflecting Iraq's resource nationalism and service contract structure
8. **Kurdistan Region** operates separate PSC regime under KRG Oil & Gas Law No. 22 of 2007, disputed by federal government as unconstitutional
9. **Federal petroleum law** remains in draft form since 2007; ongoing disputes between Baghdad and KRG over management authority
10. **Investment Law No. 13 of 2006** provides 10-15 year tax exemptions for licensed projects, though applicability to oil and gas sector subject to negotiation

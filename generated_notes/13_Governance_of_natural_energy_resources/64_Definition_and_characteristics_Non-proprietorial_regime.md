## 1. Core Framework and Legal Foundation

### 1.1 Definition of Non-Proprietorial Regime

A **non-proprietorial regime** (commonly structured as a **Production Sharing Contract (PSC)** or **Production Sharing Agreement (PSA)**) is a contractual framework through which a sovereign state grants an investor the right to explore for and extract natural resources while **the state retains legal ownership of resources throughout the entire process**, including after extraction [IMF, 2012].

The fundamental characteristic distinguishing non-proprietorial regimes from proprietorial systems is **continuous state ownership**. Under a non-proprietorial regime, the investor never acquires legal ownership of petroleum or minerals. Instead, the contractor receives:

1. A **contractual right** to recover costs from production ("cost oil/gas")
2. A **contractual share** of remaining production ("profit oil/gas")
3. **Title to its allocated share** only at the **delivery point** (not at the wellhead)

**Key Legal Principle:** The state retains **permanent legal ownership** of hydrocarbons *in situ* and after extraction; the contractor receives **economic entitlement** to a specified share of production, but ownership transfers only at the point of sale or export [Bindemann, 1999].

### 1.2 Statutory and Constitutional Basis

Non-proprietorial regimes are typically founded on:

- **Constitutional provisions** vesting subsurface resources permanently in the state (e.g., Article 27 Mexican Constitution, Article 111 Indonesian Constitution)
- **Petroleum Laws** asserting state ownership and authorizing PSC execution
- **Model PSC Templates** issued by governments defining standard fiscal terms
- **Bilateral Contracts** between state/national oil company (NOC) and international oil company (IOC)

**Example Jurisdictions:**
- **Indonesia**: Oil & Gas Law No. 22/2001 (PSC framework)
- **Malaysia**: Petroleum Development Act 1974 (Petronas as exclusive PSC counterparty)
- **Angola**: Presidential Decree 52/19 (Revised PSC Model 2019)
- **Iraq**: Model PSC 2018 (Development and Production Service Contracts)
- **Egypt**: Petroleum Law and Model PSC
- **Trinidad & Tobago**: Petroleum Act with PSC terms

The **principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources** is exercised through state **ownership retention** rather than through granting proprietary rights to investors.

## 2. Essential Characteristics of Non-Proprietorial Regimes

### 2.1 Continuous State Ownership

**Defining Feature:** Resource ownership **never transfers** to the investor. The state owns petroleum/minerals *in situ*, during extraction, and post-extraction until the investor's share is delivered.

**Legal Implications:**
- The contractor has **no legal title** to extracted resources (only contractual entitlement)
- The state (or NOC) retains **ultimate control** over resource disposition
- The contractor's share constitutes **payment for services and risk**, not ownership
- Accounting treatment: Contractor may not book reserves as "proved reserves" under certain IFRS interpretations (depends on control assessment)

### 2.2 Risk Allocation

Under non-proprietorial PSC regimes, the **contractor typically bears 100% of exploration and development risk** (except in Risk Service Contracts where the state bears cost risk). The state does not reimburse costs if no commercial discovery is made.

**Risk Profile:**
| **Risk Type** | **Borne By** |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Geological risk** (dry holes) | Contractor 100% |
| **Development cost overruns** | Contractor 100% (recovered from future production subject to ceiling) |
| **Commodity price risk** | Shared (affects both cost recovery and profit oil split) |
| **Operational risk** | Contractor 100% |
| **Political/regulatory risk** | Partially mitigated by stabilization clauses |

### 2.3 The Production Sharing Waterfall Mechanism

Non-proprietorial regimes allocate production through a **contractual waterfall**:

```
GROSS PRODUCTION (100%)
        ↓
Less: Royalty (if applicable) → to Government
        ↓
= AVAILABLE PRODUCTION
        ↓
Split into:
├─ COST OIL/GAS (50-80% ceiling)
│   → Contractor recovers operating costs (opex)
│   → Contractor recovers capital costs (capex depreciated)
│   → Unrecovered costs carried forward with uplift
│
└─ PROFIT OIL/GAS (Remainder after cost recovery)
    → Split between:
       ├─ Government Share (typically 60-85%)
       └─ Contractor Share (typically 15-40%)
```

**Key Feature:** Cost recovery is **explicit and contractual**, not dependent on domestic tax code provisions.

### 2.4 Government Revenue Mechanisms

The state captures resource rents through **production sharing** rather than primarily through taxation:

**Primary Revenue Instruments:**

1. **Royalty** (0-15%, if applicable)
   - Taken "off the top" before cost recovery
   - Provides immediate revenue from first production
   - Examples: Indonesia 15%, Egypt 10%, some Malaysian PSCs 10%

2. **Profit Oil Share** (60-85% to government)
   - Government's share of production after cost recovery
   - Represents the **primary revenue mechanism**
   - May be progressive (increasing with profitability or production levels)

3. **Corporate Income Tax** (varies by jurisdiction)
   - **Classic PSC**: Government's profit oil share is **in lieu of tax** (no separate CIT)
   - **Tax/Royalty PSC**: Contractor pays CIT **on its profit oil share** (hybrid model)
   - Examples:
     - Malaysia: No additional tax (profit oil is tax substitute)
     - Indonesia (post-2017): Contractor pays standard 22% CIT on profit share
     - Egypt: 40.55% CIT on contractor's profit oil

**Comparison Table:**

| **Jurisdiction** | **Royalty** | **Contractor Profit Oil** | **CIT on Contractor Share** | **Government Take** |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Malaysia** | 10% | 20-30% | 0% (in lieu) | ~70-80% |
| **Indonesia (Gross Split)** | 0% | 43-57% | 22% CIT | ~52-66% |
| **Angola** | 0% | 15-30% | 0% (profit oil substitute) | ~70-85% |
| **Iraq TSC** | Variable | Fee-based | 35% CIT on fee | ~85-95% |
| **Egypt** | 10% | 20-25% | 40.55% CIT | ~85-90% |

### 2.5 Cost Recovery Ceiling

The **cost recovery ceiling** (or **cost stop**) is a defining feature of non-proprietorial regimes, limiting the percentage of available production usable for cost recovery in any period.

**Typical Ceilings:**
- **50%**: Angola, conservative regimes
- **60-70%**: Malaysia (varies by water depth), Ghana, Iraq
- **80%**: Some Indonesian contracts (pre-2017)
- **100%**: No ceiling (Indonesia "Gross Split" PSCs have eliminated cost recovery entirely)

**Impact:**
```
If Available Production = 1,000,000 barrels
Cost Recovery Ceiling = 60%
Eligible Costs = $40 million
Oil price = $50/barrel

Maximum cost recovery value = 60% × 1,000,000 × $50 = $30 million
Actual eligible costs = $40 million
→ $10 million in costs must be carried forward to next period
```

**Unrecovered costs** are typically carried forward with **uplift** (interest compensation) at 2-10% per annum.

### 2.6 Contract-Level Ring-Fencing

Non-proprietorial regimes impose **strict contract-level ring-fencing**:

**Characteristics:**
- Each PSC is a **separate fiscal unit**
- Costs and revenues from one PSC **cannot offset** another PSC
- No group consolidation for tax purposes
- More restrictive than field-level or activity-level ring-fencing in proprietorial regimes

**Tax Implication:** Contractors cannot optimize tax across multiple projects in the same country.

## 3. Analytical Depth: Types of Non-Proprietorial Arrangements

### 3.1 Classic PSC (Production Sharing Only)

**Structure:**
- Government profit oil share is **in lieu of corporate income tax**
- Contractor exempt from CIT (or government pays CIT on contractor's behalf)
- Single-tier fiscal system

**Advantages:**
- Simplified tax administration
- No transfer pricing disputes on profit oil transactions
- Predictable government take through fixed profit split

**Examples:** Malaysia, Angola, Qatar, UAE, Oman

### 3.2 Tax/Royalty PSC (Hybrid System)

**Structure:**
- Contractor pays **both** CIT **and** shares profit oil
- Dual revenue mechanism increases government flexibility
- Requires tax treaty analysis (CIT is creditable in contractor's home country)

**Complexity:** Potential for **double taxation** without proper treaty relief.

**Examples:** Egypt (40.55% CIT), Indonesia post-2017 (22% CIT), Vietnam, Libya

### 3.3 Risk Service Contract (RSC)

**Structure:**
- Contractor provides services for a **fixed fee or percentage** of production
- **No cost recovery** - government bears cost risk
- Contractor has no equity stake in reserves

**Examples:** Iran buy-back contracts, historical Mexican contracts (pre-2014 reform)

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Minimal exploration risk for contractor
- Lower returns but guaranteed fee
- Used in jurisdictions with strong NOCs and political sensitivities about foreign ownership

### 3.4 Progressive and Sliding Scale PSCs

**R-Factor Based:**
- Profit split adjusts based on **cumulative revenue/cost ratio (R-Factor)**
- As R-Factor increases, government share increases
- Examples: Azerbaijan, Trinidad & Tobago, Ghana

```
R-Factor = Cumulative Revenue / Cumulative Costs

R < 1.5:  Government 60% / Contractor 40%
R 1.5-2.0: Government 70% / Contractor 30%
R > 2.0:  Government 80% / Contractor 20%
```

**Price/Production Sliding Scale:**
- Profit split varies with daily production levels or oil price
- Examples: Timor-Leste, some Nigerian PSCs

## 4. Advantages and Challenges

### 4.1 Advantages for Host Governments

1. **Retained Sovereignty:** State maintains legal ownership throughout
2. **Higher Government Take:** Typically 70-90% vs. 40-75% in proprietorial regimes
3. **Fiscal Stability:** Contractual terms resist legislative changes
4. **Political Acceptability:** Aligns with resource nationalism policies
5. **Direct Control:** State (via NOC) participates in operations and decisions

### 4.2 Advantages for Contractors

1. **Fiscal Stability:** Stabilization clauses protect against unilateral changes
2. **Cost Recovery Certainty:** Contractually defined mechanism
3. **Reduced Transfer Pricing Risk:** Limited to cost recovery audits, not full TP exposure
4. **International Arbitration:** Disputes resolved outside domestic courts (ICSID, ICC)

### 4.3 Challenges and Complexities

1. **Complex Accounting:** PSC-specific accounting separate from IFRS/GAAP
2. **Limited Loss Relief:** Contract-level ring-fencing prevents cross-project offset
3. **Cost Recovery Timing:** Ceiling and depreciation create cash flow delays
4. **Reserves Booking:** Challenges in booking proved reserves under SEC/IFRS rules
5. **Contractor Share Variability:** Revenue uncertainty due to production sharing mechanics

## 5. Worked Example: Indonesian PSC Calculation (Gross Split Model)

═══════════════════════════════════════════
**WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Indonesia Gross Split PSC**
═══════════════════════════════════════════

**Facts:**

TropicOil Indonesia operates under a 2018 Gross Split PSC (no cost recovery mechanism). Year 2025 financials:

| **Item** | **Amount** |
|----------|------------|
| Gross production | 2,000,000 barrels |
| Oil price (realized) | $60/barrel |
| Operating expenditure | $15,000,000 |
| Capital expenditure (new drilling) | $20,000,000 |
| Base split (contractor) | 43% |
| Production bonus (>100k bbl/day) | +2% |
| Onshore location adjustment | +3% |

**Required:**

Calculate contractor's net revenue and government share.

**Analysis:**

Indonesia's **Gross Split PSC** (post-2017) eliminates cost recovery. Instead, the contractor receives an **adjusted percentage** of gross production based on fiscal incentives.

**Calculation:**

**Step 1: Determine Contractor Split**

```
Base contractor split:                      43%
Progressive split adjustments:
  + Production bonus (>100k bbl/day):       +2%
  + Onshore location:                       +3%
                                            ────
Final contractor split:                     48%
Government split:                           52%
```

**Step 2: Calculate Revenue Allocation**

```
Gross production value = 2,000,000 barrels × $60 = $120,000,000

Contractor entitlement:
  48% × $120,000,000 = $57,600,000

Government entitlement:
  52% × $120,000,000 = $62,400,000
```

**Step 3: Calculate Corporate Income Tax**

```
Contractor gross revenue:           $57,600,000
Less: Operating expenditure:       ($15,000,000)
Less: Depreciation (20% × $20M):    ($4,000,000)
                                    ────────────
Taxable income:                     $38,600,000

Corporate income tax @ 22%:          $8,492,000
```

**Step 4: Net Contractor Position**

```
Contractor oil revenue:             $57,600,000
Less: Operating costs:             ($15,000,000)
Less: Capital costs (cash):        ($20,000,000)
Less: Corporate tax:                ($8,492,000)
                                    ────────────
Net cash flow (Year 1):             $14,108,000
```

**Step 5: Total Government Take**

```
Government production share:        $62,400,000
Corporate income tax collected:      $8,492,000
                                    ────────────
Total government revenue:           $70,892,000

Government take % = $70,892,000 / $120,000,000 = 59.1%
```

**Conclusion:**

Under the **Gross Split PSC** model:
- Contractor receives **48%** of gross production (before costs and tax)
- Government receives **52%** directly + **$8.5M** in corporate tax = **59.1% total take**
- **No cost recovery mechanism** means contractor bears timing risk on capital expenditure
- Contractor's after-tax, after-cost return = **11.8%** of gross revenue ($14.1M / $120M)

This model **simplifies administration** (no cost recovery audits) but **increases contractor risk** during high-capex development phases.

## 6. Cross-Border and Treaty Considerations

### 6.1 Permanent Establishment

Under non-proprietorial PSCs, the **contract area typically creates a PE** under Article 5 OECD Model Tax Convention. However, in classic PSCs where profit oil is in lieu of tax, **no separate CIT liability** arises (government take through production sharing only).

### 6.2 Tax Treaty Application (Tax/Royalty PSCs)

For PSCs where contractors pay separate CIT:

**Withholding Taxes:**
- **Dividends**: Domestic rate (often 20-25%), treaty-reduced to 5-15%
- **Interest**: 10-20% (treaties may reduce to 0-10%)
- **Royalties** (for technology/IP): 10-20% (treaties reduce to 0-10%)

**Tax Credit Relief:**
- Contractor's home country should provide **foreign tax credit** for CIT paid on profit oil share
- Critical for avoiding double taxation in hybrid PSC regimes

### 6.3 Transfer Pricing in Non-Proprietorial Regimes

Transfer pricing risk is **limited** compared to proprietorial regimes:

**Areas Subject to TP Review:**
1. **Cost recovery claims** for affiliate charges (technical services, seconded staff, head office allocations)
2. **Sale of contractor's oil share** to related parties (must be at arm's length)
3. **Financing arrangements** (interest rates on affiliate loans)

**Areas Generally NOT Subject to TP:**
- Government's profit oil share (contractually determined, not transaction-based)

---

## 7. Integration with International Agreements

Non-proprietorial regimes interact with:

**Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs):**
- Critical for protecting PSC stabilization clauses
- Provide investor-state arbitration (ICSID, ICC, UNCITRAL)
- Examples: *Occidental v. Ecuador*, *Chevron v. Republic of Ecuador*

**Tax Treaties:**
- Prevent double taxation on contractor's profit oil income
- Provide reduced withholding rates on dividends, interest, royalties
- Allocate taxing rights between source (host) and residence (contractor home) countries

**Stabilization Clauses:**
- **Frozen law clauses**: Fiscal terms frozen at contract signature (10-30 years)
- **Economic equilibrium clauses**: Rebalancing mechanism if government take changes
- **Intangibility clauses**: Contract cannot be amended without mutual consent

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Non-proprietorial regimes** retain **state ownership** of resources throughout extraction and production
2. Government revenue derived through **production sharing** (profit oil) rather than primarily through taxation
3. **Contractor bears exploration and development risk** but receives contractual cost recovery and profit share
4. **Cost recovery ceiling** (typically 50-80%) limits annual cost reimbursement, with unrecovered costs carried forward
5. **Contract-level ring-fencing** prevents cross-project loss relief
6. **Classic PSCs** have profit oil **in lieu of tax**; **hybrid PSCs** impose both profit sharing and CIT
7. **Progressive PSCs** (R-Factor, sliding scale) increase government take as profitability improves
8. Non-proprietorial regimes are the **dominant model** in developing countries and major oil exporters (Indonesia, Malaysia, Angola, Iraq, Egypt, Trinidad & Tobago)

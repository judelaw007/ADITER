This exam paper has **three parts: Part A, Part B and Part C**.

You need to answer **five questions** in total. You will **not** receive marks for any additional answers.

- **Both** questions in **Part A** (25 marks each)
- **One** question from **Part B** (20 marks)
- **Two** questions from **Part C** (15 marks each)

## Further instructions

- All workings should be made in appropriate monetary currency, unless otherwise stated. Any monetary calculations should be made to the nearest whole unit of currency. Any necessary time apportionments in your calculations should be made to the nearest whole month.

- You must provide appropriate line breaks between each question, and clearly indicate the start of each new question using the formatting tools available.

- Marks may be allocated for clarity of presentation of your answers.

- The time you spend answering questions should correspond broadly to the number of marks available for that question. You should therefore aim to spend approximately half of your time answering Part A, and the other half answering questions in Parts B and C.

- There is no separate reading time, so you can start typing your answers as soon as the exam begins. However, we recommend that you set aside some time to thoroughly read each question and plan each of your answers.

# PART A

**You are required to answer BOTH questions from this Part.**

## Question 1 (25 marks)

Global Energy Corporation (GEC) signed a concession agreement with Country M on 1 January 2022 for the exploration and production of oil and gas. The terms of the concession agreement are as follows:

1. The concession covers an area of 800 hectares and will run for 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years subject to mutual agreement.

2. GEC paid a signature bonus of $500,000 to Country M upon signing. This bonus is not recoverable against future tax liabilities and is not tax-deductible.

3. GEC incurred pre-production exploration and development costs of $25 million during 2022-2023. These costs are to be depreciated over 5 years on a straight-line basis for tax purposes.

4. GEC installed production facilities and infrastructure at a cost of $80 million in 2023. These assets have an expected useful life of 25 years and are depreciated on a straight-line basis for both accounting and tax purposes.

5. Production commenced on 1 January 2024. Annual operating costs are estimated at $8 million per year. These costs are fully deductible for tax purposes in the year incurred.

6. Country M imposes a royalty of 12.5% on gross revenues. Royalties are payable in cash and are tax-deductible expenses.

7. GEC is subject to corporate income tax at a rate of 30% on its taxable profits in Country M.

8. The government of Country M introduced a supplementary petroleum tax of 10% on adjusted profits (calculated as gross revenues less royalties, operating costs, and depreciation) when the oil price exceeds $75 per barrel. This supplementary tax is also deductible for corporate income tax purposes.

9. Production and pricing data for 2024-2025:

| Year | Production (barrels) | Oil Price ($ per barrel) |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 2024 | 1,200,000 | $80 |
| 2025 | 1,400,000 | $85 |

**You are required to:**

**1) Calculate GEC's profit after tax for the years 2024 and 2025.** (18 marks)

**2) Calculate the total government take (all revenues received by Country M) for the years 2024 and 2025, and express this as a percentage of gross revenues.** (7 marks)

**Total: 25 marks**

**1) Define economic rent and explain why it is particularly significant in the extractive industries.** (8 marks)

**2) Evaluate the effectiveness of three different fiscal instruments (such as royalties, profit-based taxes, production sharing, or supplementary taxes) in capturing economic rent, considering their advantages and disadvantages from both government and investor perspectives.** (12 marks)

**Total: 25 marks**

Question Title:
Transfer Pricing in Multinational Oil and Gas Operations

Question Number: PART A, QUESTION 2 (Pages 2-3)

Full Question Context:
"Multinational oil and gas companies operate across multiple jurisdictions, 
engaging in intercompany transactions involving crude oil, refined products, 
services and intellectual property. Transfer pricing rules ensure that these 
transactions are priced at arm's length, preventing artificial profit shifting 
to low-tax jurisdictions. However, valuation complexities, fluctuating commodity 
prices and complex intra-group financing structures can create significant tax 
risks.

Governments and international bodies have sought to impose strict transfer 
pricing regulations to safeguard tax revenues and combat base erosion and profit 
shifting (BEPS) practices."

Sub-Question 1 (5 marks):
"Explain the role of transfer pricing in oil and gas operations, and why it is 
a concern for tax authorities."

Sub-Question 2 (12 marks):
"Discuss the key transfer pricing methods used for pricing intercompany 
transactions in the upstream and downstream sectors."

Sub-Question 3 (8 marks):
"Describe how tax authorities may challenge transfer pricing methods in the oil 
and gas industry."

- Upstream sector: Crude oil, commodities, CUP method

- Methods: CUP, Cost Plus, Resale Price, Profit Split, TNMM

Topics Expected in Sub-Question 3:

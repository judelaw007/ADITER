Slide: Transfer Pricing Methods

So when we talk about traditional transaction methods,  Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) Method: Most direct and preferred method when reliable comparables exist Compares price charged in controlled transaction to price in comparable uncontrolled transaction Internal CUP: Same taxpayer's transactions with independent parties External CUP: Transactions between two independent parties Adjustments: Required for differences affecting price (volume, terms, quality) Resale Price Method (RPM): Begins with price at which product resold to independent party Reduces price by appropriate gross margin (resale price margin) Remaining amount is arm's length price paid to related supplier Best suited: Reseller adds limited value (marketing, distribution)

Energy sector application: Marketing/distribution subsidiaries Cost Plus Method (CPM): Begins with supplier's costs for products transferred Adds appropriate cost plus markup Best suited: Manufacturing, services, contract R&D Energy sector application: Service providers, contract operators Here's the thing with transactional profit methods.  Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM): Examines net profit margin relative to appropriate base (costs, sales, assets) Compares tested party's net margin to margins of comparable independent companies Profit Level Indicators (PLIs): - Return on sales (operating profit / sales) - Return on costs (operating profit / total costs) - Return on assets (operating profit / assets)

- Berry ratio (gross profit / operating expenses) Most commonly used method globally due to data availability Less sensitive to product differences than CUP Profit Split Method (PSM): Allocates combined profits (or losses) to each related party Allocation based on relative value of functions performed, assets used, risks assumed Contribution Analysis: Value contribution of each party Residual Analysis: Routine returns allocated first; residual profits allocated based on non-routine contributions Best suited: Highly integrated operations, unique intangibles, inability to identify comparables Energy sector application: Joint ventures, integrated oil companies, shared development Here's the thing with commodity pricing methods. 

Quoted Price Method (QPM): Uses publicly available commodity price quotations (e.g., Brent, WTI, Henry Hub) Adjusted for quality, transportation, timing, delivery terms Most appropriate for crude oil, natural gas, refined products Price adjustment factors: - Quality differentials (API gravity, sulfur content) - Location differentials (transportation to reference market) - Timing adjustments (forward curves, price lags) - Volume discounts/premiums Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) - Commodity Specific: Uses pricing from comparable third-party sales Common in gas marketing, product sales Requires high comparability Cost Plus / Resale Minus Methods: Less common for crude oil (commodity pricing available) May apply to specialized products, services

Here's the thing with method selection hierarchy.  OECD Approach: No strict hierarchy; select most appropriate method considering: Respective strengths/weaknesses of methods Nature of controlled transaction Availability of reliable information Degree of comparability Reliability of adjustments Practical Hierarchy (often applied): CUP (if reliable comparables exist) RPM or Cost Plus (for distributors/service providers with limited functions) TNMM (when traditional methods not reliable) PSM (for highly integrated operations, unique value creation) UN Practical Manual: Recognizes developing countries may prefer methods providing greater certainty (e.g., cost plus for services).

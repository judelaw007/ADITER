Slide: Core Framework and Statutory Basis

Tax treaties, formally termed double tax agreements (DTAs) or double tax conventions (DTCs), are bilateral or multilateral agreements governing allocation of taxing rights between jurisdictions. For the energy resources sector, treaties are critical instruments affecting investment returns, permanent establishment exposure, and cross-border payment taxation. Treaty Models and Hierarchy.  The principal treaty models are: OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (2017 edition, regularly updated with Commentaries): Reflects developed country consensus favoring residence-based taxation. Adopted primarily by capital-exporting countries. The 2017 edition incorporated tax treaty-related measures from the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project. Commentary updates continue to be issued (most recently in 2024 for Article 26 on Exchange of Information). Over 3,000 bilateral treaties worldwide are based on OECD or UN Models.

UN Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries (2021 edition): Provides greater source-country taxing rights. Favored by resource-rich developing countries. Includes lower permanent establishment (PE) thresholds, higher withholding rates, and broader service articles. The 2021 edition is the fifth edition, addressing concerns about taxation of automated digital services and offshore indirect transfers. US Model Income Tax Convention (2016): Similar to OECD Model but includes Limitation on Benefits (LOB) provisions, "savings clause" preserving US taxation of citizens/residents, and specific anti-treaty shopping rules. Released by the US Department of Treasury on February 17, 2016, updating the previous 2006 version.

Multilateral Instrument (MLI) (OECD BEPS, 2017): The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) allows simultaneous modification of multiple bilateral treaties. Signed on June 7, 2017, with over 104 jurisdictions participating as of January 2025. Implements BEPS minimum standards including Principal Purpose Test (PPT), treaty abuse prevention, and dispute resolution improvements. Here's the thing with legal hierarchy and application.  Constitutional Status: Treaties typically override domestic law in most jurisdictions (monist systems). Some jurisdictions require domestic legislation to implement treaties (dualist systems, e.g., United Kingdom).

Interpretation: Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (concluded May 23, 1969, entered into force January 27, 1980) provides interpretation framework: Ordinary meaning in context Object and purpose consideration OECD/UN Commentaries as interpretative guidance (not binding but persuasive) Domestic courts may differ on interpretation weight given to Commentaries Conflict Resolution: When treaty and domestic law conflict, more favorable provision typically applies to taxpayer (though specifics depend on domestic constitutional law).

## Topic 34: Mergers and Acquisitions
### Tax Due Diligence

---

## 1. Introduction

**1.1 The Critical Role of Tax Due Diligence**

**Tax due diligence** (Tax DD) is the comprehensive investigation and analysis of a target company's tax affairs conducted by a prospective buyer during the M&A process. It serves three critical functions:

1. **Risk Identification**: Discover hidden tax liabilities, ongoing disputes, and compliance failures
2. **Value Assessment**: Verify tax attributes (NOLs, cost recovery balances, treaty benefits)
3. **Deal Structuring**: Inform optimal transaction structure, price adjustments, and warranty negotiations

In oil and gas M&A, tax due diligence is particularly complex due to:
- **Ring-fence regimes** and petroleum-specific tax rules
- **Production Sharing Contracts** with government cost audits
- **Transfer pricing** across international affiliates
- **Decommissioning liabilities** with uncertain tax treatment
- **Cross-border structures** triggering WHT and treaty analysis

The tax DD process directly feeds into **purchase price negotiations**, **SPA warranties/indemnities**, and **post-closing integration planning**.

**1.2 Examination Focus (Advanced Level 3)**

Past ADIT exams (December 2024 Q6, June 2025 Q5) have consistently tested candidates on:

- **10 key issues** to review in tax due diligence
- Specific concerns for **oil and gas acquisitions**
- **PSC cost recovery** verification
- **Transfer pricing documentation** requirements
- **Withholding tax** compliance review

Candidates must demonstrate practical knowledge of DD procedures, red flags, and mitigation strategies.

## 3. Ten Key Issues in Oil & Gas Tax Due Diligence

Based on December 2024 Q6 and June 2025 Q5 (examiner's preferred list):

**3.1 Essential Tax Rules Applying to the Investment**

**3.1.1 Scope**

Review the **entire tax framework** applicable to the target:

- **Corporate income tax**: Rates, ring-fence provisions, special petroleum taxes
- **Withholding taxes**: Rates on dividends, interest, royalties, technical service fees
- **Indirect taxes**: VAT treatment of oil/gas sales, imported services
- **Capital gains tax**: Treatment of asset disposals and share sales
- **Transfer taxes**: Stamp duty, registration fees
- **Property/production taxes**: Severance taxes, ad valorem taxes

**3.1.2 Key Questions**

- What is the **effective tax rate** on petroleum profits?
- Are there **incentives** (allowances, exemptions) available but not utilized?
- Do **tax treaties** provide relief on cross-border payments?
- Are there **ring-fence limitations** restricting use of losses or interest deductions?

**Example - UK Ring Fence:**
- **Ring Fence Corporation Tax (RFCT)**: 30% (in addition to general 19% rate)
- **Energy Profits Levy (EPL)**: 35% (temporary surcharge on extraordinary profits)
- **Total marginal rate**: Up to 75% (19% + 30% + 35% - 29% allowance)

**DD Finding:**
> *"Target has not claimed Research & Development Tax Credits available under RFCT regime,
> representing potential £5M annual tax savings. Buyer should file amended returns post-acquisition."*

**3.2 Hydrocarbon Tax Ring-Fence Issues**

**3.2.1 Ring-Fence Scope**

Verify whether **ring-fence restrictions** apply:

**Definition:** Ring-fencing prevents petroleum profits from being offset by:
- **Non-ring-fence losses** (e.g., downstream refining, petrochemical)
- **Group relief** from non-ring-fence companies
- **Interest deductions** on debt used for non-ring-fence purposes

**3.2.2 Common Issues**

**Interest Deductibility Restrictions:**
```
If Target borrowed to acquire non-ring-fence assets (e.g., midstream pipelines),
interest may be non-deductible against ring-fence profits.

DD Verification:
- Trace use of borrowed funds
- Confirm allocation of interest expense (ring-fence vs. non-ring-fence)
- Assess risk of disallowance in audit
```

**Capital Allowances:**

Ring-fence regimes often provide **enhanced capital allowances**:
- **100% First Year Allowances** for certain assets
- **Research Expenditure Supplement (RES)**: 10% uplift on unrelieved R&D costs

**DD Task:**
- Verify Target has claimed all available allowances
- Check for **clawback provisions** if assets disposed within specified period

**3.3 Determination of Holding Structure**

**3.3.1 Analysis of Current Structure**

Map the **legal and tax structure**:

```
Example Structure:

Parent HoldCo (Netherlands)
    |
    | 100% shares
    |
Target OpCo (UK - North Sea Operations)
```

**Tax Efficiency Assessment:**

| Factor | Current Structure | Optimized Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| **WHT on dividends** | 0% (NL-UK treaty) | 0% |
| **Interest deductibility** | Limited (UK thin cap) | Improved (Luxembourg SPV) |
| **Treaty network** | Strong | Strong |
| **Substance requirements** | Met (NL office, staff) | Higher cost (Lux substance) |
| **Reputational risk** | Low | Medium (aggressive planning perception) |

**3.3.2 Restructuring Opportunities**

Identify **post-acquisition restructuring** to optimize taxes:

- **Insert holding company** in favorable jurisdiction (Luxembourg, Singapore)
- **Consolidate regional operations** to utilize cross-border losses
- **IP migration** to low-tax jurisdictions (subject to BEPS constraints)

**Caution:**
- Restructuring may trigger **exit taxes** or **capital gains**
- **GAAR** (General Anti-Avoidance Rules) may challenge aggressive structures

**3.4 Holding Structure for Partners**

**3.4.1 Joint Venture Structures**

Review **JV tax alignment**:

```
If Target is 60% owned by Seller and 40% by Partner:

Issues:
- Do Seller and Partner have compatible tax structures?
- Will Buyer's acquisition of Seller's 60% trigger change of control?
- Are there tax gross-up obligations in JV agreements?
```

**3.4.2 Carried Interest and Promote Structures**

In private equity-backed targets:

**Carried Interest:** Management's share of profits (typically 20% above hurdle rate)

**Tax Characterization:**
- Is carry treated as **capital gain** or **ordinary compensation**?
- Will acquisition trigger **accelerated vesting** and tax liability for management?

**DD Risk:**
> *"Management holds $15M unvested carried interest. Acquisition will trigger immediate vesting,
> resulting in $5M tax liability for management. Buyer may need to gross up or provide retention
> bonuses."*

**3.5 Intermediate Holding Country Considerations**

**3.5.1 Treaty Benefits Analysis**

Assess whether **intermediate holding company** optimizes:

**Dividend WHT:**
```
Direct Structure:
UK OpCo → Parent (US): 0% WHT (US-UK treaty)

Alternative:
UK OpCo → Dutch HoldCo → US Parent
  Step 1: 0% WHT (EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive)
  Step 2: 0% WHT (NL-US treaty)

No tax savings, but NL HoldCo provides:
- Flexibility for future EU acquisitions
- Access to EU treaty network
- Participation exemption on future disposals
```

**Capital Gains Tax (CGT):**
```
If Buyer later sells UK OpCo:

Direct ownership: UK CGT on gain (unless treaty exemption)
Via NL HoldCo: Netherlands participation exemption (0% CGT)
```

**3.5.2 BEPS Action 6 - Principal Purpose Test (PPT)**

**Treaty shopping** is now restricted by **PPT** in MLI (Multilateral Instrument):

**PPT Wording:**
> *"A benefit under a tax treaty shall not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude that
> obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement."*

**DD Assessment:**
- Does intermediate HoldCo have **economic substance**?
- Are there **non-tax commercial reasons** for the structure?
- Risk of treaty benefit denial?

**3.6 Tax Leakage Calculation**

**3.6.1 Definition**

**Tax leakage** = Total taxes paid along the chain from source income to ultimate parent.

**3.6.2 Calculation Methodology**

**Example - Dividend Repatriation:**

```
Scenario: UK OpCo generates £100M profit, distributes to US Parent

Step 1: UK Corporate Tax
Profit before tax:        £100.0M
UK RFCT (30% + 19%):       -49.0M
Net after UK tax:         £51.0M

Step 2: Dividend WHT (UK → US)
Dividend:                 £51.0M
WHT (0% per treaty):        0.0M
Net received by US Parent: £51.0M

Step 3: US Tax
Foreign income:           £51.0M (grossed up: £100M)
US tax at 21%:             21.0M
Less: Foreign tax credit: -49.0M (UK tax paid)
Additional US tax:          0.0M (FTC fully offsets)

Net to US Parent:         £51.0M
Total tax leakage:        £49.0M (49%)
```

**Optimized Structure with Luxembourg HoldCo:**

```
UK OpCo → Lux HoldCo → US Parent

Step 1: UK tax:           -£49.0M (same)
Step 2: UK → Lux WHT:      0% (EU Directive)
Step 3: Lux tax:           0% (participation exemption)
Step 4: Lux → US WHT:      0% (treaty)
Step 5: US tax:           +/-0% (FTC)

Total leakage:            £49.0M (no improvement in this case)
```

**Leakage only improves if:**
- **Lux HoldCo has other income** to utilize UK losses
- **Future CGT exemption** on disposal
- **Access to better treaty network**

**3.7 Seller's Tax Position**

**3.7.1 Seller's Taxable Gain**

Estimate **seller's tax liability** to inform price negotiations:

```
Asset Sale Scenario:

Seller's adjusted basis in assets:  £200M
Purchase price:                     £600M
Gain:                               £400M

Tax (assuming recapture):
  Depreciation recapture (ordinary): £150M × 25% = £37.5M
  Capital gain:                      £250M × 20% = £50.0M
Total seller tax:                   £87.5M
```

**Implications:**
- Seller will demand **higher price** to cover tax cost (~£90M additional)
- **Share sale** would save seller £20-30M in taxes (preference for share sale)

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- Buyer offers **share sale** at lower price (e.g., £580M vs. £600M asset sale)
- Seller saves £87.5M tax, Buyer pays £20M less
- **Both benefit** from tax-efficient structure

**3.7.2 Indemnity Escrow Calculation**

Based on DD findings, determine **appropriate escrow**:

```
Identified Tax Risks:
- Transfer pricing adjustment (likelihood 40%): £10M
- Withholding tax dispute (likelihood 60%): £5M
- Depreciation disallowance (likelihood 20%): £3M

Expected value: (£10M × 40%) + (£5M × 60%) + (£3M × 20%) = £7.6M

Recommended escrow: £10M (130% of expected value)
Escrow period: 18 months (to cover audit period)
```

**3.8 Transfer Taxes and Stamp Duty**

**3.8.1 Transaction-Specific Taxes**

Quantify **one-time taxes** triggered by acquisition:

**UK Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT):**
- **Share purchase**: 0.5% stamp duty on consideration
- **Asset purchase (real property)**: SDLT at graduated rates (up to 5%)

**Example:**
```
Share sale of £500M:
Stamp duty: £500M × 0.5% = £2.5M (payable by Buyer)

Asset sale (including £100M land):
SDLT on land: £100M × 5% = £5.0M
Stamp duty on equipment: £0 (exempt)
Total transfer taxes: £5.0M
```

**VAT on Asset Sales:**

In some jurisdictions, asset sales trigger **VAT**:

```
Indonesia: VAT at 11% on asset transfers (unless exemption applies)
Asset sale price: $100M
VAT: $11M (potentially recoverable as input tax credit)
Cash impact: $11M upfront (refund in 6-12 months)
```

**3.9 Carry-Forward Tax Losses**

**3.9.1 Verification of NOL Balances**

Review **documentation supporting NOL claims**:

1. **Tax return schedules** showing NOL calculations and carryforward amounts
2. **Tax authority correspondence** confirming accepted losses
3. **Changes in ownership** that may have triggered Section 382 or equivalent limitations
4. **Expiration dates** (where applicable)

**Example DD Finding:**
> *"Target reports £50M NOL carryforwards on balance sheet. However, review of tax returns
> reveals:
> - £10M disallowed in prior audit (not adjusted in records)
> - £15M expired under 20-year carryforward rule
> - £25M remaining NOLs verified and available
>
> Impact: Reduce NOL asset value by £25M in purchase price allocation."*

**3.9.2 Post-Acquisition Utilization Limitations**

Model **Section 382 limitation** (US) or equivalent:

```
Target NOLs: $100M
Target FMV: $80M
Long-term tax-exempt rate: 4%

Annual limitation: $80M × 4% = $3.2M per year

If Target generates $20M annual income:
- Without Section 382: Use $20M NOLs per year (deplete in 5 years)
- With Section 382: Use $3.2M per year (deplete in 31+ years)

PV of NOLs (21% tax rate, 10% discount):
- Without limitation: $100M × 21% × 3.791 (5-year annuity) = $79.6M
- With limitation: $100M × 21% × 9.246 (perpetuity approximation) = $19.4M (capped)

Value impairment: $60.2M
```

**Buyer should demand price reduction** reflecting NOL limitation.

**3.10 PSC Cost Recovery Balances**

**(Most Important for Oil & Gas M&A)**

**3.10.1 Verification Process**

**Step 1: Obtain Government-Audited Cost Statements**

Request:
- **Final audited cost pool** balances from Host Government
- **Cost audit reports** for last 3-5 years
- **Disputed costs** log and resolution status

**Step 2: Reconcile to Target's Records**

```
Target's Internal Records: Unrecovered Costs = $150M
Government Audited Balance: Unrecovered Costs = $135M

Difference: $15M

Root Causes:
- $8M costs disallowed (non-arm's length service fees)
- $5M costs pending government approval (may be disallowed)
- $2M timing difference (costs submitted but not yet approved)

Conservative position: Use $135M (government figure)
```

**Step 3: Review Cost Disallowance History**

Analyze **patterns of disallowance**:

| Year | Costs Submitted | Costs Disallowed | Disallowance % | Reasons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year -3 | $50M | $2M | 4% | Transfer pricing adjustments |
| Year -2 | $60M | $5M | 8% | Non-recoverable admin costs |
| Year -1 | $55M | $3M | 5% | Excessive contractor fees |

**Finding:**
> *"Average 5-6% disallowance rate suggests aggressive cost recovery practices.
> Buyer should reserve $7-10M for future disallowances on pending $135M cost pool."*

**3.10.2 Cost Carry Deals - Verification**

If acquisition involves **assignment of PSC interest** with cost carry arrangements:

**Verify:**
- **Government consent** to assignment (required under most PSCs)
- **Carry obligations** are honored (does carried party's costs transfer?)
- **Cost recovery waterfall** (priority of cost recovery among partners)

---

## 4. Worked Examples

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Comprehensive Tax DD Findings Report

**Facts:**

Buyer Corp is acquiring Target Oil Ltd, a UK-based North Sea operator, for **£400 million** (share purchase). Buyer engages tax advisors to conduct tax DD.

**Key DD Findings:**

**1. Tax Compliance Issues:**
- Late filing of VAT returns in 3 of last 24 months (£15K penalties paid)
- WHT return for Q3 Year-2 missing (£2M WHT should have been withheld on service fees to non-residents)

**2. Ring-Fence Losses:**
- Target has **£80M ring-fence losses** carried forward
- However, **£30M** relates to pre-2010 exploration costs under old regime (may expire)

**3. Transfer Pricing Audit:**
- HMRC has opened transfer pricing audit for Years -3 to -1
- Focus: Management service fees paid to parent (3% of revenue = £12M/year)
- HMRC proposes 1.5% arm's length rate → potential adjustment: **£18M** (3 years × £6M/year)

**4. Decommissioning Reserve:**
- Target has **£50M decommissioning liability** on balance sheet
- Tax reserve for decommissioning: **£20M** (40% tax rate)
- DD discovers: Government now requires **earlier decommissioning** (5 years earlier than planned)
- Revised decommissioning cost: **£70M** (£20M increase)

**5. PSC - Norway License:**
- Target holds 25% interest in Norwegian offshore license (PSC-style regime)
- Unrecovered costs: NOK 300M (~£25M) per Target's records
- Norwegian government audit: NOK 270M (£22.5M) approved, NOK 30M (£2.5M) disputed

**Required:**

1. Quantify **total tax risk exposure**
2. Recommend **SPA warranty and indemnity** provisions
3. Suggest **price adjustment** or **escrow**
4. Propose **post-closing actions** to mitigate risks

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Quantification of Tax Risks**

| Risk Item | Probability | Exposure | Expected Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WHT deficiency (Year -2)** | 90% | £2.0M + penalties £0.5M = £2.5M | £2.25M |
| **Transfer pricing adjustment** | 60% | £18M + interest £3M = £21M | £12.6M |
| **Ring-fence loss expiry** | 50% | £30M × 19% tax = £5.7M | £2.85M |
| **Decommissioning increase** | 80% | £20M × 40% = £8M (tax benefit lost) | £6.4M |
| **Norway cost disallowance** | 70% | £2.5M × 78% Norway tax = £1.95M | £1.37M |
| **Total Expected Value** | | | **£25.47M** |

**High/Low Range:**
- **Best case** (all risks resolved favorably): £2.5M (WHT only - highly certain)
- **Worst case** (all risks materialize): £39.15M

**Part 2: SPA Warranty and Indemnity Recommendations**

**Tax Warranties:**
```
Seller warrants:
(a) All Tax Returns have been timely filed and are accurate (subject to Disclosed Exceptions)
    → Exception: Disclose late VAT filings and WHT deficiency

(b) No transfer pricing disputes or adjustments
    → Cannot give this warranty (HMRC audit ongoing)
    → Buyer should require specific indemnity

(c) Decommissioning estimates are based on latest government requirements
    → False - government changed timing
    → Warranty breach (or disclose in Schedule)

(d) All PSC cost pools have been audited and accepted by Host Governments
    → False - NOK 30M disputed
    → Require disclosure and specific indemnity
```

**Tax Indemnity:**
```
Seller shall indemnify Buyer for:

(a) All Pre-Completion Tax Liabilities, including:
    (i) WHT deficiency (Year -2): Up to £2.5M
    (ii) Transfer pricing adjustment: Up to £25M (capped)
    (iii) Norway PSC cost disallowance: Up to £2.0M

(b) Any increase in decommissioning costs above £50M to the extent such increase
    relates to governmental action or requirements existing as of Completion Date

(c) Penalties and interest attributable to items (a) and (b)

EXCEPT:
- Matters disclosed in Tax Disclosure Schedule
- Indemnity limited to aggregate cap of £40M (10% of purchase price)
```

**Part 3: Price Adjustment and Escrow**

**Option 1: Immediate Price Reduction**
```
Base purchase price: £400M
Less: Tax risk adjustment (expected value): -£25M
Revised price: £375M
```

**Option 2: Escrow**
```
Purchase price: £400M (unchanged)
Escrow amount: £30M (held for 24 months)
Escrow release:
- If HMRC transfer pricing audit resolved < £18M: Release difference
- If Norway costs accepted: Release £2M
- After 24 months: Release balance (if no claims)
```

**Recommended: Hybrid Approach**
```
Purchase price: £390M (£10M reduction for WHT + high-probability items)
Escrow: £20M (for transfer pricing and decommissioning risks)
```

**Part 4: Post-Closing Mitigation Actions**

**Action 1: Resolve WHT Deficiency**
- File late WHT return immediately
- Pay £2M WHT + penalties
- Claim indemnity from Seller (£2.5M)

**Action 2: Engage in HMRC Transfer Pricing Settlement**
- Provide benchmarking study supporting 2-2.5% arm's length rate
- Negotiate settlement at £10-12M (vs. £21M proposed)
- Use escrow funds to cover settlement

**Action 3: Revalidate Ring-Fence Losses**
- File protective claim for pre-2010 losses before expiry
- Engage UK tax counsel to maximize loss preservation

**Action 4: Update Decommissioning Reserve**
- Revise accounting estimate to £70M
- Claim tax deduction for £20M increase (over time as costs incurred)

**Action 5: Norway PSC Cost Pool**
- Submit additional documentation to Norwegian government supporting disputed NOK 30M
- Accept partial disallowance (e.g., NOK 10M) to close audit

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2: Transfer Pricing DD - Red Flags

**Facts:**

Target Drilling Services Inc. (Target) provides drilling and technical services to oil & gas operators globally. Buyer is conducting tax DD.

**Target's Intercompany Structure:**

```
Target (US) - Technical services provider
    |
    | Services provided to:
    |
    +-- Affiliate A (Cayman Islands) - IP holding company
    +-- Affiliate B (Singapore) - Regional trading hub
    +-- Affiliate C (Nigeria) - Local service entity
```

**Intercompany Transactions (Annual):**

| Transaction | Amount | Transfer Pricing Method | Documentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Drilling services to Affiliate C** | $50M | Cost Plus 8% | None (related party, no TP study) |
| **IP royalty to Affiliate A** | $20M | 5% of revenue | License agreement (no benchmarking) |
| **Management fees from Affiliate B** | $5M | Allocated costs | Cost allocation policy (no comparables) |

**DD Findings:**

**1. Affiliate C (Nigeria) - Underpricing Risk:**
- Target charges Affiliate C **Cost + 8%** for drilling services
- Affiliate C resells to third-party Nigerian operators at **Cost + 40%**
- **Comparable independent drilling service providers** charge Cost + 25-35%

**Red Flag:** Target appears to be **underpricing** services to Affiliate C, shifting profits to Nigeria (lower tax jurisdiction).

**2. Affiliate A (Cayman) - IP Ownership:**
- Affiliate A (Cayman tax haven) owns "proprietary drilling technology"
- Target developed technology (R&D costs: $30M over 5 years)
- Target pays **5% royalty** to Affiliate A (no consideration received for IP transfer)

**Red Flag:** **IP migration** to Cayman without arm's length compensation. IRS may challenge under **Section 482** (periodic adjustments).

**3. Affiliate B (Singapore) - Substance Issues:**
- Affiliate B receives **$5M management fees** from Target
- DD reveals: Affiliate B has **1 employee** (part-time), no office
- **No evidence** of management services provided

**Red Flag:** **Lack of substance**. Tax authorities may **disallow** $5M deduction and recharacterize as non-deductible capital contribution.

**Required:**

1. Quantify **potential transfer pricing adjustments** and tax exposure
2. Assess **documentation gaps** and penalties
3. Recommend **risk mitigation** strategies

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Transfer Pricing Adjustment Quantification**

**Issue 1: Nigeria Services Underpricing**

**Arm's Length Analysis:**

Comparable service providers charge **Cost + 25-35%** (median: Cost + 30%)

Target charges: Cost + 8%

Assume Cost base: $50M ÷ 1.08 = **$46.3M**

**Arm's length price:** $46.3M × 1.30 = **$60.2M**
**Actual price charged:** $50M
**Understatement:** $10.2M per year

**Tax Impact (assuming 3-year audit period):**

```
Adjustment (3 years): $10.2M × 3 = $30.6M
US tax at 21%: $30.6M × 21% = $6.4M
Interest and penalties (40%): $6.4M × 40% = $2.6M
Total Exposure (US): $9.0M
```

**Nigerian Tax Impact:**

Nigeria will likely assess **matching downward adjustment** (disallow $30.6M deductions at Affiliate C):

```
Nigeria tax at 30%: $30.6M × 30% = $9.2M
Total Double Tax: $9.0M (US) + $9.2M (Nigeria) = $18.2M
```

**Issue 2: Cayman IP - Periodic Adjustment**

IRS may assert **Section 482** periodic adjustment for undervalued IP transfer.

**Comparable Royalty Rate:** 8-12% (industry benchmark for oil & gas technology)

**Target pays:** 5%

**Adjustment:** 3-5 percentage points × $20M base = **$0.6M - $1.0M per year**

**Tax Exposure (5 years):**
```
Adjustment: $1M × 5 years = $5M
Tax + penalties: $5M × 21% × 1.4 = $1.5M
```

**However, more significant:**

IRS may assert **exit tax** on initial IP transfer to Cayman, valuing IP at $50M+:

```
FMV of IP (DCF of future royalties): $80M
Cost basis (R&D costs capitalized): $30M
Deemed gain: $50M
Tax at 21%: $10.5M
```

**Issue 3: Singapore Management Fees - Disallowance**

**Arm's Length:** No services rendered = **$0 arm's length fee**

**Adjustment:** Disallow full $5M per year

**Tax Exposure (3 years):**
```
Disallowed deductions: $5M × 3 = $15M
Tax at 21%: $15M × 21% = $3.15M
Penalties (20%): $3.15M × 20% = $0.63M
Total: $3.78M
```

**Total Transfer Pricing Exposure:**

| Risk | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| Nigeria underpricing | $9.0M | $18.2M (if double tax) |
| Cayman IP periodic | $1.5M | $10.5M (if exit tax) |
| Singapore fees | $3.78M | $3.78M |
| **Total** | **$14.28M** | **$32.48M** |

**Part 2: Documentation Gaps and Penalties**

**US IRC Section 6662(e) - Transfer Pricing Penalties:**

**40% penalty** applies if:
- Transfer pricing adjustment exceeds $5M, **and**
- No **contemporaneous documentation** exists

**Target's Position:**
- **No transfer pricing studies** for any transactions
- **Substantial penalty exposure**: 40% of tax on adjustments = **$5.7M - $13M**

**Part 3: Risk Mitigation Strategies**

**Pre-Closing:**

1. **Demand Seller Indemnity:**
   ```
   Seller indemnifies Buyer for all transfer pricing adjustments, assessments,
   and penalties arising from transactions in periods ending on or before Completion.

   Cap: $35M (covers high estimate)
   Time limit: 7 years (IRS statute of limitations)
   ```

2. **Escrow:**
   ```
   Escrow $25M of purchase price for 24 months pending resolution of TP risks
   ```

3. **Price Reduction:**
   ```
   Reduce purchase price by $15M (expected value of TP exposure)
   ```

**Post-Closing:**

1. **Prepare Transfer Pricing Studies:**
   - Engage Big 4 to prepare **contemporaneous TP documentation** for all intercompany transactions
   - File **Master File and Local Files** under BEPS Action 13

2. **Restructure IP Ownership:**
   - **Buy back IP** from Cayman to US (pay arm's length price)
   - Or: Increase royalty rate to 8-10% (arm's length)

3. **Terminate Singapore Entity:**
   - Close Affiliate B (no substance)
   - Cease management fee payments

4. **Reprice Nigeria Services:**
   - Increase service fees to Affiliate C to **Cost + 30%** (arm's length)
   - Document with **CUP method** benchmarking study

5. **Consider VDP (Voluntary Disclosure Program):**
   - File voluntary disclosure with IRS for prior years
   - Potential penalty relief (reduce from 40% to 0-20%)

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3: PSC Cost Recovery DD - Government Audit Dispute

**Facts:**

Target holds **40% participating interest** in PSC offshore Indonesia. Buyer is conducting DD.

**PSC Terms:**
- Cost recovery ceiling: **80%** of gross production revenues
- Profit oil split: **35% Contractor / 65% Government**
- Corporate tax: **48%** (Government pays from its share - "gross split")

**Target's Reported Unrecovered Costs (40% basis):** $120 million

**DD Process:**

**Step 1:** Request government-audited cost statements.

**Government (BPMIGAS) Audit Report shows:**

| Cost Category | Target Claimed | BPMIGAS Approved | Disallowed | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Drilling costs** | $80M | $75M | $5M | Excessive contractor fees |
| **G&G surveys** | $20M | $18M | $2M | Non-arm's length affiliate charges |
| **Facilities** | $30M | $28M | $2M | Non-compliant procurement |
| **Admin overhead** | $10M | $5M | $5M | Exceeds 5% limit per PSC |
| **Total (40% basis)** | **$140M** | **$126M** | **$14M** | |

**Government Accepted Balance:** $126M (not $120M reported by Target)

**Discrepancy Analysis:**
```
Target's internal records:   $120M
Government approved:         $126M
Difference:                  +$6M (in Target's favor)
```

**Root Cause:** Target had conservatively **not booked $6M** of costs pending final government audit approval. These costs are now approved.

**However:**
```
Target originally submitted: $140M
Government approved:         $126M
Disallowed:                  $14M (10% disallowance rate)
```

**Step 2:** Review ongoing disputes.

**Pending Dispute:**

Target is appealing **$8M** of the $14M disallowances:

| Item | Amount | Target's Position | Government's Position |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Drilling contractor fees** | $5M | Arm's length (supported by bid process) | Excessive vs. Indonesian benchmarks |
| **G&G survey (affiliate)** | $2M | Market rate (comparable independent quotes obtained) | Must use government-approved providers |
| **Admin overhead** | $1M | Should be 7% (not 5%) per newer PSC interpretation | PSC clearly states 5% limit |

**Target's likelihood of success:**
- Drilling fees: **60% chance** of recovery (strong documentation)
- G&G survey: **30% chance** (weak legal basis)
- Admin overhead: **10% chance** (PSC language clear)

**Expected recovery:** ($5M × 60%) + ($2M × 30%) + ($1M × 10%) = **$3.7M**

**Required:**

1. Determine **verified unrecovered cost pool** for purchase price purposes
2. Calculate **value of cost recovery** benefit
3. Quantify **downside risk** if appeals fail
4. Recommend **SPA treatment** of disputed costs

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Verified Cost Pool**

**Conservative Position (for Purchase Price Allocation):**

```
Government approved costs:        $126.0M
Less: Amount under appeal (exclude): -$8.0M
Verified, undisputed cost pool:   $118.0M
```

**Buyer should value acquisition based on $118M cost pool** (exclude disputed amounts).

**Upside Potential:**

If Target succeeds in appeal:
```
Upside: $3.7M (expected value) to $8M (best case)
```

**Part 2: Value of Cost Recovery**

Assume cost pool is recovered over **5 years** as production ramps up.

**Annual Recovery:** $118M ÷ 5 = **$23.6M per year**

**Tax Benefit of Cost Recovery:**

Cost oil reduces taxable income, saving **48% corporate tax**:

```
Annual tax savings: $23.6M × 48% = $11.33M per year
```

**However, in Indonesian PSC, Government pays tax** from its share, so contractor does not directly pay 48% tax.

**Correct Analysis:**

Cost recovery allows contractor to receive **more oil** before splitting profit oil:

```
Without cost recovery:
Gross revenue: $100M
Profit oil (split 35/65): Contractor receives $35M

With $23.6M cost recovery:
Gross revenue: $100M
Cost oil to contractor: $23.6M
Profit oil remaining: $100M - $23.6M = $76.4M
Contractor's share (35%): $76.4M × 35% = $26.74M
Total to contractor: $23.6M + $26.74M = $50.34M (vs. $35M without cost recovery)
```

**Benefit:** **$15.34M additional cash** per year due to cost recovery.

**Present Value (5 years, 12% discount rate):**

```
PV = $15.34M × 3.605 (PV factor) = $55.3M
```

**Value of $118M cost pool ≈ $55M PV**

**Part 3: Downside Risk**

If Target **loses all appeals** (worst case):

```
Additional disallowed costs: $8M
Lost tax benefit: $8M × (similar multiplier) ≈ $3.5M PV
```

**Buyer's risk:** Overpaying by $3.5M if appeals fail.

**Part 4: SPA Treatment**

**Option 1: Conservative - Exclude Disputed Costs from Price**

```
Purchase Price based on:
- $118M verified cost pool
- If appeals succeed, Seller retains benefit
```

**Fairness:** Low (Seller loses potential upside)

**Option 2: Contingent Consideration**

```
Base Purchase Price: Based on $118M cost pool

Earnout: If appeals succeed, Buyer pays Seller:
- 50% of PV of recovered costs

Example: If $5M recovered:
  PV benefit to Buyer ≈ $2.2M
  Payment to Seller: $1.1M (50% sharing)
```

**Fairness:** High (risk/reward shared)

**Option 3: Seller Retains Appeals**

```
Seller continues to prosecute appeals post-closing.
If successful, recovered costs benefit Seller's retained rights.

Problem: Seller has no ongoing interest post-closing (sold 100% of PSC interest).
Not feasible.
```

**Recommended: Option 2 (Contingent Consideration)**

```
SPA Clause:

"Purchase Price is based on Government-approved unrecovered costs of $126M, less
$8M currently under appeal.

If Target's appeal results in additional cost approvals within 24 months of Completion:

Seller shall receive a payment equal to 50% of the Present Value of such recovered costs,
calculated as:

Payment = (Recovered Costs) × (PV Multiplier) × 50%

Where PV Multiplier = 0.44 (based on 5-year recovery, 12% discount, 35% profit oil share)"

Example:
If $5M costs recovered:
Payment = $5M × 0.44 × 50% = $1.1M to Seller
```

**Conclusion:**

PSC cost recovery balances require **rigorous verification** via government audits. Disputes should be **conservatively valued** with **contingent consideration** mechanisms to allocate risk fairly.

## 5. Conclusion

Tax due diligence is the cornerstone of successful M&A execution in the oil and gas sector. The ten key issues identified by ADIT examiners provide a comprehensive framework for identifying risks, verifying tax attributes, and structuring optimal deal terms.

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Government-audited PSC cost pools** - never rely solely on target's internal records
2. **Transfer pricing documentation** - biggest source of hidden tax exposure
3. **Ring-fence loss verification** - limitations and expiration dates determine value
4. **Tax leakage modeling** - optimize holding structures pre-closing
5. **Warranty and indemnity drafting** - DD findings directly inform SPA protections

Effective tax DD requires coordination between tax advisors, legal counsel, commercial teams, and reservoir engineers to synthesize technical, legal, and tax analysis into actionable deal recommendations.

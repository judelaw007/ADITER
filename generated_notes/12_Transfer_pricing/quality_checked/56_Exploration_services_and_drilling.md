# 56. Exploration Services and Drilling

## 1. Introduction

**Exploration and drilling services** represent a significant category of intra-group transactions in the oil and gas sector. Multinational groups often centralize technical expertise in specialized subsidiaries that provide **seismic acquisition and processing**, **geological and geophysical (G&G) analysis**, **reservoir engineering**, and **drilling services** to operating affiliates worldwide.

Transfer pricing for these services requires careful analysis under the **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (2022), Chapter VII (Special Considerations for Intra-Group Services)** and application of appropriate methods—typically **Cost Plus** for routine services or **TNMM (Transactional Net Margin Method)** for more complex service arrangements.

**Purpose of intra-group service centralization**: Centralizing technical services allows multinational groups to achieve economies of scale by pooling specialized expertise, expensive software licenses, and technical equipment. This structure can deliver cost efficiencies and higher quality services compared to each operating entity maintaining separate capabilities. However, transfer pricing must ensure charges reflect arm's length pricing and pass the benefit test.

Key considerations include: **benefit test** (does the recipient derive value?), **arm's length charge** (cost plus markup or fee-based), **shareholder activities** (non-deductible services benefiting parent), and **documentation** of technical specifications and comparables.

## 2. Types of Exploration and Drilling Services

### 2.1 Seismic Acquisition and Processing

**A. Seismic Acquisition**

**Activity**: Collecting subsurface data using **seismic waves** (onshore: vibroseis trucks; offshore: seismic vessels towing airgun arrays and streamers).

**Service provider models**:

| **Model** | **Description** | **Transfer Pricing Method** |
|---|---|---|
| **Captive seismic subsidiary** | Group-owned entity with equipment and crew provides seismic acquisition to operating affiliates | **Cost Plus** (equipment depreciation + crew costs + markup) |
| **Service contract with third party** | Operating company contracts independent seismic company (e.g., CGG, TGS); no intercompany transaction | **N/A** (arm's length inherent) |
| **Cost recharge** | Parent or regional headquarters contracts third-party seismic company and recharges cost to operating affiliates | **Cost recharge** (typically no markup if purely administrative) |

**Purpose of Cost Plus method**: For captive seismic subsidiaries, the Cost Plus method is appropriate because the service provider functions as a cost center with limited risk. The entity deploys capital equipment and personnel to perform routine acquisition services, earning a return commensurate with these limited functions and risks.

**Cost Plus example**:

```
Captive SeismicCo (UAE subsidiary) acquires 3D seismic for OperatingCo (Iraq affiliate):

Direct costs:
- Vessel charter: $10 million (6-month survey)
- Crew salaries: $3 million
- Fuel and supplies: $2 million
Total direct costs: $15 million

Indirect costs (allocated from HQ):
- Management overhead: $1 million
- IT and data management: $500,000
Total indirect costs: $1.5 million

Total costs: $16.5 million

Comparable markup analysis:
- Independent seismic contractors earn 10-15% markup on costs (WesternGeco, Polarcus)
- Selected arm's length markup: 12%

Arm's length service fee: $16.5M × 1.12 = $18.48 million
```

**B. Seismic Processing and Interpretation**

**Activity**: Processing raw seismic data (noise reduction, imaging, depth conversion) and interpreting geological structures (identifying prospects).

**Service provider models**:
- **Centralized G&G center**: Parent or regional HQ employs geophysicists who process and interpret seismic data for operating affiliates
- **Third-party processing**: Operating company contracts specialized processor (Schlumberger, Halliburton)

**Transfer pricing considerations**:
- **Seismic processing** (routine, standardized): **Cost Plus** method with **5-10% markup**
- **Seismic interpretation** (requires specialized expertise, proprietary software): **Cost Plus** with **10-20% markup** or **TNMM** if entity also performs other G&G services

### 2.2 Geological and Geophysical (G&G) Services

**Activities**:
- **Basin analysis**: Studying tectonic history, stratigraphy, depositional environments
- **Prospect evaluation**: Assessing hydrocarbon potential (trap, reservoir, source, seal)
- **Volumetric calculations**: Estimating recoverable reserves (P10, P50, P90)
- **Well planning**: Determining optimal well locations and drilling trajectories

**Transfer pricing method**: **Cost Plus**

**Typical markup**: **10-15%** on costs (reflects specialized expertise but limited risk—no performance guarantees)

**Comparables**:
- Independent G&G consulting firms (e.g., boutique consultants, retired industry geologists)
- Service divisions of oilfield service companies (Halliburton Consulting, Baker Hughes)

**Example**:

```
G&G Center (Houston, centralized subsidiary) provides reservoir characterization for 5 operating affiliates:

Annual costs:
- Geologist/geophysicist salaries: $8 million (40 professionals)
- Software licenses (Petrel, Kingdom): $1 million
- Office and overhead: $1.5 million
Total costs: $10.5 million

Allocation to affiliates:
- By time spent on each affiliate's projects (time tracking system)
- Nigeria OpCo: 1,200 hours (20% of total) → $2.1 million cost allocation

Markup: 12% (based on comparables analysis)
Service fee to Nigeria OpCo: $2.1M × 1.12 = $2.352 million
```

### 2.3 Reservoir Engineering Services

**Activities**:
- **Reservoir simulation**: Modeling fluid flow, pressure decline, recovery factors
- **Production forecasting**: Estimating future production profiles
- **Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) design**: Waterflooding, CO2 injection, steam injection
- **Well performance analysis**: Analyzing production data, optimizing well interventions

**Transfer pricing method**: **Cost Plus** or **TNMM**

**Typical markup**: **12-18%** on costs (reservoir engineering requires advanced expertise, proprietary simulation software, and close integration with field operations)

**Comparables**:
- Independent reservoir engineering consultants (DeGolyer & MacNaughton, Gaffney Cline)
- Oilfield service companies (Schlumberger Reservoir Consulting)

### 2.4 Drilling Services

**A. Drilling Contractor (Equipment-Intensive)**

**Activity**: Providing drilling rig, crew, and equipment to drill wells.

**Service provider models**:
- **Captive drilling subsidiary**: Group-owned drilling company with rigs
- **Third-party drilling contractor**: Independent rig owner (Transocean, Seadrill, Helmerich & Payne)

**If captive drilling subsidiary**:
- **Transfer pricing method**: **Cost Plus** including:
  - Rig depreciation (CAPEX amortization)
  - Crew costs
  - Maintenance and supplies
  - Markup (5-12% depending on rig complexity and market conditions)

**Market dynamics**: Drilling rig day rates are **publicly available** (e.g., **IHS Petrodata**, **Rigzone**), providing strong comparables for **CUP method** (if day-rate structure used) or benchmarking Cost Plus markup.

**Example**:

```
DrillCo (U.S. subsidiary) provides jackup rig to operate offshore Mexico field (related MexicoOpCo):

Rig day rate (3-year contract, 2025):
- Market day rates for comparable jackup rigs (150-200 ft water depth): $85,000-110,000/day (IHS Petrodata, Q1 2025)
- DrillCo selected day rate: $95,000/day (midpoint)

Transfer pricing method: **CUP** (market day rate)
Arm's length day rate: $95,000

Annual cost (365 days × $95,000): $34.675 million
```

**B. Drilling Engineering and Well Planning**

**Activity**: Designing well trajectories, casing programs, mud programs; real-time drilling support.

**Transfer pricing method**: **Cost Plus**

**Typical markup**: **10-15%** on costs

**Comparables**:
- Independent drilling engineering consultants
- Drilling engineering divisions of service companies (Halliburton, Baker Hughes)

---

## 3. Benefit Test (OECD Chapter VII)

### 3.1 Principle

The **benefit test** assesses whether a service provides **economic or commercial value** to the recipient that enhances its commercial position.

**OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 2022, Chapter VII, para. 7.6**:

> "An intra-group service has been rendered when an activity provides a member of the MNE group with economic or commercial value to enhance its commercial position."

**Purpose of benefit test**: This test prevents multinational groups from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions by charging for services that provide no genuine economic benefit to the recipient. Tax authorities deny deductions for services that fail this test.

**Application to exploration services**:
- **Seismic acquisition**: Clear benefit to operating company (subsurface data essential for drilling decisions)
- **G&G analysis**: Benefit if analysis improves prospect selection or reduces exploration risk
- **Reservoir engineering**: Benefit if services optimize production and increase recovery

### 3.2 Shareholder Activities (Non-Deductible)

**Shareholder activities** are services performed by the parent **for its own benefit as shareholder**, not for the benefit of the subsidiary.

**Examples of shareholder activities** (OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 2022, Chapter VII, para. 7.9-7.10):
- **Costs of holding company structure**: Legal entity maintenance, board meetings, shareholder reporting
- **Costs of acquiring subsidiaries**: Due diligence, M&A advisory fees
- **Governance and compliance for parent**: Parent's statutory audit, investor relations

**Application to oil and gas**:

| **Activity** | **Benefit to Subsidiary?** | **Deductible?** |
|---|---|---|
| **Seismic acquisition for subsidiary's license area** | Yes (enables drilling decisions) | ✓ Yes |
| **Regional exploration study** (evaluating multiple basins for future entry) | **No** (benefits parent's investment decisions, not specific subsidiary operations) | ✗ No (shareholder activity) |
| **Reservoir engineering for subsidiary's field** | Yes (optimizes production) | ✓ Yes |
| **Parent's investor relations** (presenting subsidiary results to shareholders) | No (benefits parent) | ✗ No (shareholder activity) |

**Transfer pricing implication**: Charges for shareholder activities are **not arm's length** and should not be recharged to subsidiaries.

### 3.3 Duplication of Services

**Issue**: If a subsidiary **already performs** a service or **could obtain it more cheaply** from third parties, charging for duplicative intra-group services may not meet the benefit test.

**Example**:

```
Operating Company (Angola) employs in-house geologists who perform prospect evaluation.

Parent (UK) also performs prospect evaluation for Angola license and charges £500,000.

Benefit test analysis:
- Angola already has capability (in-house geologists)
- Parent's service is **duplicative**
- Unless Parent's service provides **additional value** (e.g., advanced simulation software not available in Angola, specialized expertise), charge may fail benefit test

Result: Angola may not be able to deduct £500,000 service charge; transfer pricing adjustment by Angolan tax authority
```

**Best practice**: Document **value-added** by parent service (e.g., proprietary technology, specialized expertise not available locally, faster turnaround time).

---

## 4. Arm's Length Pricing Methods

### 4.1 Cost Plus Method (Preferred for Services)

**Application**: Most common method for exploration and drilling services where the service provider is a **cost center** with limited risk.

**Steps**:

1. **Determine cost base**:
   - **Direct costs**: Salaries of geologists/engineers, travel, equipment depreciation
   - **Indirect costs**: Allocated overhead (office rent, IT, HR, management)

2. **Select arm's length markup**:
   - Benchmarking study identifying independent service providers
   - Analyze **EBIT/Cost** or **Gross Profit/Cost** margins

3. **Calculate arm's length service fee**:
   ```
   Service Fee = Total Costs × (1 + Markup)
   ```

### 4.2 Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)

**Application**: When service provider performs **multiple functions** (not purely routine) or operates as **profit center**.

**Net Profit Indicator (NPI)**: **Operating Margin (EBIT/Sales)** or **Return on Costs (EBIT/Costs)**

**Example**:

```
Integrated Services Co. (Singapore) provides exploration, reservoir engineering, and drilling engineering to 10 operating affiliates:

Annual revenue (service fees charged): $50 million
Annual costs: $40 million
Operating profit (EBIT): $10 million
Operating Margin: $10M ÷ $50M = 20%

Comparables analysis:
- Independent oilfield service companies (excluding equipment-intensive drilling contractors): Operating margins 12-20%
- Selected arm's length range: 12-18% (interquartile)
- Services Co. margin (20%) is at upper end but within range

Conclusion: Arm's length pricing (no adjustment)
```

### 4.3 CUP Method (for Drilling Rig Day Rates)

**Application**: When **market day rates** are available for comparable drilling rigs.

**Data sources**:
- **IHS Petrodata**: Database of drilling rig contracts and day rates
- **Rigzone**: Rig day rate index
- **ODS-Petrodata**: Offshore rig market reports

**Comparability factors**:
- **Rig type**: Jackup, semi-submersible, drillship
- **Water depth capability**: Shallow water (<500 ft), deepwater (>5,000 ft), ultra-deepwater (>10,000 ft)
- **Rig age**: Newer rigs command premium
- **Geographic market**: North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, Asia-Pacific
- **Contract term**: Spot (single well) vs. term (multi-year)

## 5. Documentation Requirements

### 5.1 Service Agreement

**Key terms**:
- **Scope of services**: Detailed description (seismic acquisition, G&G analysis, reservoir simulation, drilling)
- **Deliverables**: Seismic data (processed or interpreted), technical reports, well designs
- **Pricing**: Cost plus markup, day rate, or fixed fee
- **Payment terms**: Monthly, quarterly, upon delivery
- **Performance standards**: Quality specifications, delivery timeline

**Example clause**:

> "Service Provider (G&G Center, Houston) shall provide geological and geophysical analysis for Recipient (Operating Company, Nigeria) including seismic interpretation, prospect evaluation, and volumetric calculations. Service fees shall be calculated on a Cost Plus basis: total costs (direct and allocated indirect) plus 12% markup, invoiced quarterly. Payment due within 30 days of invoice."

### 5.2 Time Tracking and Cost Allocation

**Critical for Cost Plus method**: Accurate tracking of time spent by each employee on each affiliate's projects.

**Systems**:
- **Time tracking software**: Employees log hours by project and entity
- **Cost allocation keys**: Allocate indirect costs (office, IT, management) based on headcount or time spent

**Example**:

```
G&G Center employs 40 geologists serving 8 operating affiliates:

Total annual costs: $12 million

Time tracking data (2025):
- Norway OpCo: 8,000 hours (20%)
- Angola OpCo: 6,000 hours (15%)
- Brazil OpCo: 4,000 hours (10%)
- [Other affiliates]: 22,000 hours (55%)

Cost allocation to Norway OpCo: $12M × 20% = $2.4 million
Markup (12%): $2.4M × 0.12 = $288,000
Service fee to Norway OpCo: $2.688 million
```

### 5.3 Comparables Analysis (Benchmarking Study)

**Required components**:

1. **Search criteria**: Independent service providers in oilfield services sector
2. **Financial data**: EBIT/Costs or EBIT/Sales margins
3. **Functional comparability**: Similar services (excluding equipment-intensive drilling contractors if analyzing engineering services)
4. **Adjustments**: Account for differences (size, geography, risk profile)
5. **Arm's length range**: Interquartile range (25th-75th percentile)

**Sample comparables** (engineering services):

| **Company** | **Services** | **EBIT/Costs** |
|---|---|---|
| DeGolyer & MacNaughton | Reservoir engineering consulting | 15% |
| Gaffney Cline | Petroleum engineering consulting | 18% |
| RPS Energy | Geoscience consulting | 12% |
| AGR Group | Engineering and consulting | 14% |
| **Median** | — | **14.5%** |

**Conclusion**: 12-18% markup on costs is arm's length for specialized engineering services.

## 6. Worked Example

═══════════════════════════════════════════
**WORKED EXAMPLE: Transfer Pricing for Exploration and Drilling Services**
═══════════════════════════════════════════

**Facts:**

MegaOil plc (UK-listed multinational) has established **TechServ Ltd.** (UAE subsidiary) to provide centralized technical services to group operating companies:

**Services provided by TechServ** (2025):
1. **Seismic processing**: Processing 3D seismic data for offshore blocks
2. **G&G analysis**: Prospect evaluation and volumetric calculations
3. **Reservoir engineering**: Simulation and production forecasting
4. **Drilling engineering**: Well planning and real-time drilling support

**Recipients**:
- **AngolaCo** (Angola subsidiary): 30% of TechServ's time
- **BrazilCo** (Brazil subsidiary): 25% of TechServ's time
- **NigeriaCo** (Nigeria subsidiary): 25% of TechServ's time
- **IraqCo** (Iraq subsidiary): 20% of TechServ's time

**TechServ financial data (2025)**:

```
Direct costs:
- Employee salaries (50 engineers/geophysicists): $15 million
- Software licenses (Petrel, Kingdom, Eclipse): $2 million
- Travel and consumables: $1 million
Total direct costs: $18 million

Indirect costs (allocated from MegaOil HQ):
- Management oversight: $1.5 million
- IT infrastructure: $1 million
- Office facilities (Dubai): $500,000
Total indirect costs: $3 million

Total costs: $21 million
```

**MegaOil transfer pricing policy**:
- **Method**: Cost Plus
- **Markup**: 15% on costs

**Angola tax authority audit (2026)**:
- Challenges 15% markup as excessive
- Claims 8-10% is appropriate based on "local market conditions"
- Proposes adjustment: Reduce AngolaCo's deductible service fees by $315,000 (5% of AngolaCo's allocation)

**Required:**

1. Calculate service fees charged to each operating affiliate using Cost Plus method
2. Prepare benchmarking analysis to defend 15% markup
3. Assess benefit test for AngolaCo
4. Determine likely outcome of Angola audit and propose resolution

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Cost Allocation to Each Affiliate**

```
Total TechServ costs: $21 million

Allocation by time spent:
- AngolaCo: 30% × $21M = $6.3 million
- BrazilCo: 25% × $21M = $5.25 million
- NigeriaCo: 25% × $21M = $5.25 million
- IraqCo: 20% × $21M = $4.2 million
```

**Step 2: Apply Cost Plus Markup**

```
Markup: 15%

Service fees:
- AngolaCo: $6.3M × 1.15 = $7.245 million
- BrazilCo: $5.25M × 1.15 = $6.0375 million
- NigeriaCo: $5.25M × 1.15 = $6.0375 million
- IraqCo: $4.2M × 1.15 = $4.83 million

Total service fees: $24.15 million
TechServ profit: $24.15M - $21M = $3.15 million
Operating margin: $3.15M ÷ $21M = 15%
```

**Step 3: Benchmarking Analysis (Defending 15% Markup)**

**Objective**: Demonstrate that 15% markup on costs is arm's length for integrated technical services (seismic processing, G&G, reservoir engineering, drilling engineering).

**Search criteria**:
- **Industry**: Oilfield services (SIC 1382, 1389, 8711, 8712)
- **Services**: Geophysical, geological, reservoir engineering, drilling engineering consulting
- **Exclude**: Equipment-intensive drilling contractors (Transocean, Seadrill) and integrated service majors with manufacturing (Schlumberger, Halliburton entire group)
- **Include**: Consulting/engineering services divisions and independent consultants
- **Geography**: Global
- **Financial data**: EBIT/Costs (Return on Costs) for latest fiscal year

**Selected comparables**:

| **Company** | **Country** | **Services** | **EBIT/Sales** | **EBIT/Costs** (approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DeGolyer & MacNaughton** | USA | Reservoir engineering, reserves certification | 13.5% | 15.6% |
| **Gaffney Cline** | UK | Petroleum engineering consulting | 15.2% | 17.9% |
| **RPS Energy** | UK | Geoscience and reservoir consulting | 10.8% | 12.1% |
| **AGR Group** | Norway | Engineering and technical services | 12.3% | 14.0% |
| **Oilfield Technologies** | Canada | Drilling and production engineering | 11.5% | 13.0% |
| **Ikon Science** | UK | Subsurface software and consulting | 14.0% | 16.3% |

**Statistical analysis**:

```
EBIT/Costs (Return on Costs):
- Minimum: 12.1% (RPS Energy)
- 25th percentile (Q1): 13.0%
- Median: 14.8%
- 75th percentile (Q3): 16.9%
- Maximum: 17.9% (Gaffney Cline)

Interquartile range (IQR): 13.0% to 16.9%
```

**Conclusion**:

**TechServ's 15% markup falls within the interquartile range (13.0-16.9%)**, demonstrating arm's length pricing.

**Rationale**:
- TechServ provides **integrated services** across multiple disciplines (seismic, G&G, reservoir, drilling)
- Comparable companies (DeGolyer & MacNaughton, Gaffney Cline, AGR) providing similar services earn 13-18% return on costs
- TechServ's 15% markup aligns with **median** of comparables (14.8%)

**Step 4: Benefit Test Assessment (AngolaCo)**

**Question**: Do services provided by TechServ deliver economic value to AngolaCo?

**Analysis**:

**Service 1: Seismic processing**
- AngolaCo holds offshore exploration licenses requiring seismic data
- AngolaCo does **not** have in-house seismic processing capability (no software, no trained geophysicists)
- Alternative: Contract third-party processor (e.g., CGG) at market rates of $8-12 per sq km
- **Conclusion**: ✓ **Benefit exists**; TechServ provides essential service unavailable internally

**Service 2: G&G analysis**
- AngolaCo employs 5 geologists but lacks advanced interpretation software (Petrel, Kingdom cost $400,000+)
- TechServ provides access to software and specialized interpretation expertise
- **Conclusion**: ✓ **Benefit exists**; TechServ provides value-added capability (software, expertise) beyond AngolaCo's internal resources

**Service 3: Reservoir engineering**
- AngolaCo's producing fields require reservoir simulation for production optimization
- AngolaCo has 2 reservoir engineers but limited simulation software (Eclipse, CMG cost $300,000+)
- TechServ performs simulations and forecasts production profiles
- **Conclusion**: ✓ **Benefit exists**; TechServ augments AngolaCo's limited reservoir engineering capability

**Service 4: Drilling engineering**
- AngolaCo plans to drill 6 wells in 2025 (3 exploration, 3 development)
- TechServ designs well trajectories, casing programs, mud programs (critical for safe drilling)
- Alternative: Hire third-party drilling engineer at $200,000+ per well
- **Conclusion**: ✓ **Benefit exists**; TechServ provides cost-effective drilling engineering vs. third-party alternative

**Overall benefit test**: ✓ **PASS** — All services provide clear economic value to AngolaCo, enhancing its ability to explore, develop, and produce hydrocarbons profitably.

**No shareholder activities identified**: TechServ charges only for services directly benefiting AngolaCo's operations (not parent-level investor relations, governance, or acquisition activities).

**Step 5: Angola Tax Authority Challenge**

**Angola position**:
- 15% markup is excessive
- Local Angolan service providers charge 8-10%
- Proposed adjustment: Reduce markup from 15% to 10% (midpoint)

**Impact**:
```
AngolaCo current service fee: $7.245 million (at 15% markup)
Angola-proposed service fee: $6.3M × 1.10 = $6.93 million (at 10% markup)
Disallowed deduction: $7.245M - $6.93M = $315,000

Additional Angola tax: $315,000 × 25% (Angola CIT rate) = $78,750
Plus penalties (50%): $39,375
Total Angola liability: $118,125
```

**MegaOil defense**:

1. **Benchmarking study**: Present comparables analysis showing 15% markup falls within arm's length range (13.0-16.9% IQR)

2. **Functional comparability**: Angolan "local service providers" cited by tax authority are:
   - Junior geologists providing basic services (not integrated seismic/G&G/reservoir/drilling)
   - Do not possess advanced software (Petrel, Eclipse cost $700,000+ licenses)
   - Not functionally comparable to TechServ's integrated services

3. **Geographic comparability**: OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 2022 allow use of **global comparables** when local comparables are not functionally comparable (Chapter III, para. 3.34-3.36)

4. **Contemporaneous documentation**: MegaOil prepared Local File in Q1 2025 (before tax year) documenting 15% markup and comparables analysis

**Proposed resolution**:

**Option 1: Defend position**
- Provide benchmarking study to Angola tax authority
- Argue functional differences between TechServ (integrated services, advanced software) and local providers (basic services)
- Request withdrawal of adjustment

**Likely outcome**: **Partial success** — Angola may accept 13-14% markup (lower end of IQR) rather than proposed 10%.

**Option 2: Bilateral APA**
- Seek **bilateral APA** between **UK (HMRC)** and **Angola (Ministry of Finance)** under **UK-Angola tax treaty Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)**
- Pre-approve 15% markup (or negotiate to 14%) for 5-year term (2026-2030)
- Cost: $200,000-400,000 (application, advisor fees)
- Benefit: Eliminates future audit risk

**Recommendation**: Pursue **Option 2 (Bilateral APA)** given:
- Material transaction ($7.245M annually)
- Recurring services (will continue indefinitely)
- Existing controversy (Angola already challenging)
- Double taxation risk (if Angola adjusts up and UK does not provide correlative relief)

**APA would provide**:
- 5-year certainty (no annual audits)
- Elimination of double taxation risk
- Agreed methodology (Cost Plus with specified markup)
- ROI: $118K annual savings (avoiding penalties) × 5 years = $590K benefit vs. $200-400K APA cost

## 7. Practical Application Guidance

**Method Selection Framework**:

1. **Cost Plus** for service providers functioning as cost centers with limited risk
2. **TNMM** for service entities performing multiple functions or operating as profit centers
3. **CUP** when market prices available (drilling rig day rates)

**Markup Ranges by Service Type**:

| **Service Type** | **Typical Markup Range** | **Rationale** |
|---|---|---|
| **Seismic processing** (routine) | 5-10% | Standardized processing, limited expertise |
| **Seismic interpretation** | 10-20% | Specialized expertise, proprietary software |
| **G&G analysis** | 10-15% | Specialized expertise, limited risk |
| **Reservoir engineering** | 12-18% | Advanced expertise, simulation software |
| **Drilling engineering** | 10-15% | Technical expertise, well design |
| **Integrated services** (multi-discipline) | 13-18% | Economies of scale, advanced capabilities |

**Documentation Best Practices**:

1. **Service agreements**: Detailed scope, deliverables, pricing, payment terms
2. **Time tracking**: Accurate allocation of costs by project and entity
3. **Benchmarking study**: Updated every 2-3 years with comparable companies
4. **Benefit test documentation**: Demonstrate economic value to recipient
5. **Contemporaneous preparation**: Document pricing before or when services rendered

**Common Pitfalls**:

1. **Failing benefit test**: Charging for duplicative services already performed internally
2. **Shareholder activities**: Charging for parent-level governance, investor relations
3. **Inadequate cost allocation**: Using arbitrary allocation keys rather than time tracking
4. **Stale benchmarking**: Relying on comparables data >3 years old
5. **Missing service agreements**: No written contracts documenting scope and pricing

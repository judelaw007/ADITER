# Permanent Establishments and Tax Treaties

## 1. Core Framework and Conceptual Foundation

### 1.1 Permanent Establishment Definition Under Article 5 OECD Model

A **permanent establishment (PE)** represents the fundamental threshold determining when a foreign enterprise may be subject to source-country taxation on business profits. Under **Article 5** of the **OECD Model Tax Convention (2017)**, a PE is defined as "a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on."

The PE concept serves as the jurisdictional nexus for business profit taxation, distinguishing it from withholding taxes on passive income. Without a PE, business profits are taxable only in the enterprise's residence state under **Article 7(1)**.

**Constitutional Significance**: The PE threshold balances:
- **Source country** interests: Right to tax profits arising from economic activity within territory
- **Residence country** interests: Protection against excessive source-country taxation
- **Taxpayer** interests: Certainty regarding tax obligations and administrative burden

**Three-Part Test for Article 5(1) PE**:
1. **Place of business**: Physical location at disposal of enterprise
2. **Fixed**: Sufficient degree of permanence (location and time)
3. **Through which business carried on**: Active business operations conducted

### 1.2 Treaty vs. Domestic Law PE - Critical Distinctions

**Domestic Law PE**: Many jurisdictions impose broader PE definitions under domestic tax law:
- **United States**: "Trade or business within the United States" - potentially broader than treaty PE
- **United Kingdom**: Permanent establishment under domestic law may include activities beyond treaty PE
- **Nigeria**: Significant Economic Presence (SEP) test introduced 2020 - nexus based on revenue thresholds, digital presence
- **India**: Business connection test - broader than treaty PE

**Treaty PE Protection**: Tax treaties typically provide **more restrictive** PE definitions, offering protection through:
- **Negative list** (Article 5(4)): Exclusions for preparatory/auxiliary activities
- **Time thresholds**: Construction PE duration requirements
- **Independent agent exception**: Article 5(6) protection
- **Specific exclusions**: Storage, display, purchasing facilities

**Interaction Rules**:
- **Treaty override**: Where treaty exists, treaty PE definition typically supersedes domestic law (subject to domestic constitutional requirements)
- **Most favorable provision**: If domestic law more favorable, some jurisdictions permit taxpayer election
- **Savings clause**: US treaties contain "savings clause" preserving US taxation of citizens/residents regardless of treaty
- **Domestic anti-avoidance**: Some jurisdictions apply domestic PE rules to deny deductions/credits even when treaty prevents taxation

**Critical Energy Sector Consideration**: Resource-rich countries often negotiate treaties with **lower PE thresholds** than OECD Model, particularly for:
- Construction activities (shorter durations)
- Service PE provisions (not in OECD Model pre-2017)
- Offshore installations (specific territorial scope provisions)
- Supervisory activities (separate, shorter thresholds)

### 1.3 Energy Sector Specific PE Issues

**Unique Characteristics Creating PE Exposure**:

1. **Physical Infrastructure**: Oil/gas operations inherently involve fixed locations:
   - **Production facilities**: Wells, platforms, FPSOs, pipelines
   - **Processing facilities**: LNG plants, refineries, separation facilities
   - **Support facilities**: Warehouses, workshops, offices

2. **Territorial Scope Questions**:
   - **Offshore installations**: Whether located on "territory" for treaty purposes
   - **Continental shelf**: Extended jurisdiction under UNCLOS and domestic law
   - **Flag state vs. coastal state**: Vessels and mobile rigs jurisdiction
   - **Territorial waters vs. EEZ**: Different tax treatment potential

3. **Mobile Assets**:
   - **Drilling rigs**: Semi-submersible, jack-up rigs - degree of permanence
   - **Seismic vessels**: Survey ships conducting exploration activities
   - **FPSOs**: Floating production, storage, and offloading vessels
   - **Supply vessels**: Support craft and equipment transport

**Article 5(2) Energy-Specific Provision**: "Mine, oil or gas well, quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources" expressly constitutes PE from day one - **no duration threshold**.

**Implications**:
- Production operations immediately create PE
- Exploration activities may not create PE (unless "place of extraction")
- Development phase activities contextual (construction PE analysis)
- Decommissioning activities require separate analysis

## 2. Technical Rules and Treaty Provisions

### 2.1 General PE - Article 5(1)

**Elements Analysis**:

**"Place of business"**: Requires space at enterprise's disposal:
- **Ownership not required**: Leased, licensed, or de facto control sufficient
- **Size immaterial**: Office, storage room, single desk may suffice
- **Examples in energy sector**: Office for administrative staff, warehouse for equipment, workshop for maintenance, field office at project site

**"Fixed"**: Two dimensions:
- **Geographic fixation**: Specific, identifiable location (GPS coordinates for offshore platforms)
- **Temporal permanence**: Sufficient duration (OECD Commentary: 6-12 months generally, but contextual)

**"Through which business carried on"**:
- **Active business operations**: Not merely passive presence
- **Core or ancillary**: Main business or supporting activities (unless Article 5(4) exception)
- **Agency**: May be satisfied through dependent agent (Article 5(5))

**Key Energy Sector Cases**:
- **North Sea oil platforms**: Held to constitute fixed place from installation (UK: *DLW Clarion*, German cases)
- **Pipeline**: May constitute PE along entire route or at collection/distribution points (depends on treaty interpretation)
- **Remote operations**: Automated facilities may constitute PE even without personnel if business conducted through facility

### 2.2 Specific PE Inclusions - Article 5(2)

Article 5(2) provides **non-exhaustive list** of places deemed PE:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- **Mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources**

**Critical Energy Provision**: "Mine, oil or gas well, quarry or any other place of extraction"

**Interpretation Issues**:

**"Place of extraction"**:
- **Production operations**: Clearly included from day one
- **Exploration activities**: Debatable - is exploration well prior to production determination a "place of extraction"?
  - **OECD Commentary**: Suggests extraction requires actual resource removal
  - **Bilateral practice**: Many treaties include exploration activities explicitly
- **Enhanced recovery**: Secondary/tertiary recovery operations constitute extraction
- **CO2 sequestration**: Novel issue - arguably not "extraction" but utilization of geological formation

**"From day one"**: No duration threshold - immediate PE upon commencement

**Distinction from Article 5(3)**: Construction/installation activities subject to duration thresholds (Article 5(3)), but once operational extraction commences, Article 5(2) applies indefinitely.

**Offshore Application**:
- OECD Commentary confirms Article 5(2) applies to offshore wells/platforms within treaty scope
- Territorial scope definitions in treaties critical (many specify "continental shelf" inclusion)
- Flag state considerations for mobile units

### 2.3 Construction PE - Article 5(3)

**Article 5(3) OECD Model**: "Building site or construction or installation project constitutes permanent establishment only if it lasts more than twelve months."

**Key Parameters**:

| Model/Treaty Type | Construction PE Threshold | Supervisory Activities |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **OECD Model** | 12 months | Included in construction |
| **UN Model** | 6 months | Separate provision, 6 months |
| **Developing Country Treaties** | 3-6 months typical | Often 3-6 months separately |
| **US Model** | 12 months | Included in construction |

**Energy Sector Application**:

**"Building site, construction, or installation project"**:
- **Pipeline construction**: Entire project typically treated as single project (even if geographically dispersed)
- **Platform installation**: Offshore platform installation and commissioning
- **LNG facility construction**: Multi-year construction projects
- **Refinery construction**: Major infrastructure development
- **Well drilling**: Individual well drilling may not exceed threshold; multiple wells require aggregation analysis

**Duration Calculation - Critical Rules**:

1. **Commencement**: When enterprise begins preparatory work on-site (mobilization)
2. **Completion**: When work substantially complete or permanently abandoned
3. **Interruptions**:
   - **Short interruptions** (seasonal, weather, supplies): Time included in duration
   - **Extended interruptions**: May break continuity if work fundamentally changed or contractors changed
4. **Multiple contracts**: Same project aggregated even if separate contracts (substance over form)

**Worked Example - Aggregation**:
- Contractor A: Platform fabrication and installation, January-September 2024 (9 months)
- Contractor A: Subsea pipeline installation, October 2024-March 2025 (6 months)
- **Total**: 15 months - **PE exists** (related activities, same contractor, same geographical area)

### 2.4 Service PE

**UN Model Article 5(3)(b)**: "The furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise for such purpose, but only if activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within a Contracting State for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned."

**Service PE not in OECD Model (pre-2017)**: OECD Model traditionally did not include service PE; Article 14 (Independent Personal Services) deleted in 2000. However:
- **2017 OECD Commentary update**: Acknowledges some treaties include service PE
- **Bilateral treaty practice**: Many treaties (especially with developing countries) include service PE provisions
- **Threshold variation**: 90 days, 120 days, 183 days common

**Energy Sector Service PE Exposures**:

**High-Risk Services**:
1. **Seismic survey services**: Geophysical data acquisition (vessels or land-based)
2. **Drilling services**: Rig contractors providing drilling services
3. **Engineering services**: FEED, detailed design, project management
4. **Technical services**: Reservoir engineering, production optimization
5. **Commissioning services**: Start-up and commissioning specialists
6. **Maintenance services**: Ongoing maintenance contracts
7. **Training services**: Operations training for local personnel

**Duration Calculation - Service PE Specific Issues**:

**"Any twelve-month period commencing or ending in fiscal year"**: Rolling 12-month calculation:
- Not limited to calendar year or fiscal year
- Any consecutive 12-month period examined
- Requires tracking of all presence days continuously

**"Same or connected project"**:
- **Same project**: Clearly aggregated
- **Connected project**: Functional relationship, commercial relationship, geographical relationship
- **Example**: Seismic survey followed by exploration drilling - likely connected

**"Through employees or other personnel"**:
- **Direct employees**: Clearly included
- **Subcontractors**: Generally excluded unless dependent agent principles apply
- **Seconded personnel**: May be attributed to seconding enterprise depending on control/supervision

### 2.5 Agency PE - Article 5(5) and (6)

**Article 5(5) - Dependent Agent PE**: "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person—other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies—is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise..."

**2017 MLI Modification - BEPS Action 7**: Broader dependent agent PE:
- **Authority to conclude contracts**: Expanded to include contracts that are binding on enterprise OR routinely concluded without material modification
- **Habitually exercises**: Repeated pattern of contract conclusion
- **In the name of enterprise**: Or for transfer of ownership or use rights to property owned by enterprise or for provision of services by enterprise

**Energy Sector Agency PE Scenarios**:

**Marketing affiliates**: Local marketing subsidiary purchasing crude from parent and reselling:
- **Traditional commissionaire**: Agent sells in own name on behalf of principal - creates PE for principal under MLI
- **Buy-sell distributor**: Independent distributor - no PE created
- **Distinction**: Control, risk, pricing authority

**Joint venture arrangements**:
- **Operator**: NOC or contractor operating on behalf of joint venture partners
- **Analysis**: Whether operator acts as agent or in independent capacity for non-operating partners
- **Contractual structure**: Joint operating agreements specify agency relationships

**Drilling contractors**:
- Rig contractor drilling for IOC - typically independent contractor (Article 5(6) protection)
- Drilling contractor affiliated with IOC - may create agency PE depending on authority and independence

**Article 5(6) - Independent Agent Exception**: "An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business."

**Independence Criteria**:
1. **Legal independence**: Separate legal entity
2. **Economic independence**: Bears own risk, receives arm's length remuneration
3. **Acts for multiple principals**: Not exclusively or almost exclusively for one enterprise
4. **Ordinary course of business**: Activities typical for that agent category

**MLI Anti-Abuse Addition**: Independent agent exception denied if person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one or more closely related enterprises.

### 2.6 Negative List - Article 5(4) Preparatory/Auxiliary Exception

**Article 5(4) OECD Model**: Following activities do NOT constitute PE:
- (a) Use of facilities solely for storage, display, delivery of goods/merchandise
- (b) Maintenance of stock solely for storage, display, delivery
- (c) Maintenance of stock solely for processing by another enterprise
- (d) Maintenance of fixed place solely for purchasing goods/merchandise or collecting information
- (e) Maintenance of fixed place solely for preparatory or auxiliary activities
- (f) Any combination of (a)-(e)

**Pre-BEPS vs. Post-BEPS (MLI) Article 5(4)**:

**Traditional Interpretation**: Activities automatically exempt if fall within listed categories (per se exceptions)

**Post-BEPS/MLI Interpretation**: Listed activities must be preparatory or auxiliary in character:
- **Preparatory**: Activities preliminary to core business (e.g., market research, promotion)
- **Auxiliary**: Activities supporting core business but not themselves core (e.g., administrative support)
- **Core business**: Activity that constitutes essential/significant part of enterprise's business

**Energy Sector Application**:

**Storage facilities**:
- **Crude oil storage**: If incidental to production/trading - potentially auxiliary
- **Strategic storage**: If storage and logistics IS the business - not auxiliary (PE exists)
- **LNG storage**: Context-dependent analysis

**Supply bases**: Offshore oil/gas supply bases:
- **Pure storage/loading**: Potentially Article 5(4)(a) exception
- **Maintenance and repair**: If significant operations - core business activity (PE exists)
- **Coordination and management**: Beyond preparatory/auxiliary (PE exists)

**Representative offices**:
- **Information gathering only**: Article 5(4)(d) exception
- **Marketing and promotion**: May be preparatory
- **Contract negotiation**: Beyond preparatory (PE exists)

**BEPS Action 7 Fragmentation Concern**: MLI introduces anti-fragmentation rule:
- Article 5(4) exceptions do not apply if enterprise/closely related enterprises conduct complementary functions in same state
- Functions constitute complementary parts of cohesive business operation
- **Example**: Separate warehousing entity and sales entity - examined together

## 3. PE Profit Attribution and Tax Computation

### 3.1 Authorized OECD Approach (AOA) - Article 7

**Article 7(1)**: "The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State."

**Article 7(2) - AOA**: "For the purposes of this Article and Article 23 A or 23 B, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in each Contracting State are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise."

**AOA Two-Step Process**:

**Step 1: Functional and Factual Analysis**
- **Functions performed** by PE: Activities, decisions, services
- **Assets used** by PE: Tangible assets (equipment, inventory), intangible assets (technology, contracts)
- **Risks assumed** by PE: Economic risks borne by PE activities

**Step 2: Comparability Analysis and Profit Attribution**
- **Internal dealings**: Notional transactions between PE and head office recognized for attribution purposes
- **Arm's length pricing**: Transfer pricing principles apply to internal dealings
- **Independent enterprise comparison**: PE treated as separate enterprise dealing at arm's length

**Key Principles**:

**"Functionally separate enterprise"**: PE treated as if separate entity (but legal fiction - single entity for legal purposes)

**Internal dealings recognized**:
- **Sale of goods**: HO to PE or PE to HO - arm's length pricing
- **Services**: Management services, technical services - arm's length fees
- **Interest**: Notional interest on attributed capital - arm's length rates
- **Royalties**: Use of intangibles - arm's length royalties (subject to treaty provisions)

**Free capital**: PE must be attributed sufficient equity capital to support functions and risks:
- **Thin capitalization**: Domestic thin cap rules may apply to PE
- **Capital attribution**: Based on assets, risks, regulatory requirements for comparable standalone enterprise

### 3.2 Energy Sector Profit Attribution Methodology

**Exploration and Production PE**:

**Production Revenue Attribution**:
- **Full revenue**: Where PE conducts production operations (Article 5(2) well/mine)
- **Proportionate revenue**: Where PE provides services to production operations
- **No revenue**: Where PE conducts pure exploration (no production yet)

**Cost Attribution**:
1. **Direct costs**: Costs directly incurred by PE activities
   - Operating expenditures (OPEX): Production operations, well maintenance
   - Capital expenditures (CAPEX): Drilling, facilities, equipment (depreciation)
   - Personnel costs: Employees working for PE

2. **Indirect costs**: Head office allocations
   - **Management services**: Corporate overhead, G&A
   - **Technical services**: Engineering, geoscience, technology
   - **Interest**: Notional interest on free capital and intra-company debt
   - **Allocation basis**: Revenue, headcount, costs, or specific identification

**Intangible Asset Issues**:
- **Technology**: Drilling technology, production optimization technology - royalties for PE use
- **Contracts**: Petroleum contract/license - valuable intangible developed/acquired by whom?
- **Seismic data**: Exploration data - ownership and compensation for use

**OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines Application**: PE profit attribution follows same principles as Article 9 transfer pricing for associated enterprises:
- **Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP)**: For commodity sales (crude, gas)
- **Cost plus**: For service provision
- **Transactional net margin method (TNMM)**: For complex integrated operations
- **Profit split**: For unique intangibles or highly integrated operations

**Documentation Requirements**: Many jurisdictions require PE-specific transfer pricing documentation:
- **Functional analysis**: Functions, assets, risks of PE
- **Economic analysis**: Comparability analysis and profit attribution methodology
- **Financial accounts**: Separate accounts for PE (even if not separate legal entity)

### 3.3 Treaty Tie-Breaker Rules and Dual Residence

**Corporate Dual Residence (Article 4(3))**: Where legal entity resident in both contracting states, tie-breaker:

**Traditional (pre-MLI) OECD Model Article 4(3)**: "Place of effective management" (POEM)
- Location where key management and commercial decisions made
- Senior executives' location
- Board meetings location
- Day-to-day management location

**MLI Article 4(3) Modification**: Dual resident corporations resolved by **mutual agreement procedure** between competent authorities (no automatic POEM test)

**Energy Sector Relevance**: International oil companies with management presence in multiple jurisdictions risk dual residence:

**Example**:
- **Shell plc**: Incorporated Netherlands (historical), headquarters and POEM arguably UK or Netherlands
- **BP p.l.c.**: Incorporated UK, global operations management
- **Tax treaty application**: Determines which state has residence taxation rights, affects worldwide income taxation and treaty access

**PE Tie-Breaker** (multiple PE locations): Where activities span multiple states:
- **Separate PE analysis**: Each state analyzed independently
- **Profit attribution**: Proportion profits based on functions in each state
- **No double counting**: Ensure revenues/profits not attributed to multiple PEs for same activity

## 4. BEPS MLI Impact on PE - Recent Developments

### 4.1 BEPS Action 7 - Preventing Artificial Avoidance of PE Status

**MLI (Multilateral Instrument) - 2017**: Implements BEPS recommendations to prevent PE avoidance:

**Key PE Changes in MLI**:

**1. Article 12 MLI - Artificial Avoidance of PE Through Commissionaire Arrangements**

**Issue**: Commissionaire structures avoiding PE:
- Parent enterprise (foreign) owns goods/risk
- Local subsidiary (commissionaire) sells goods in own name on behalf of parent
- No PE created under traditional Article 5(5) (no contracts "in name of" parent)

**MLI Solution - Expanded Article 5(5)**:
"An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State... if a person is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of the enterprise and... habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise, and these contracts are:
(i) in the name of the enterprise, or
(ii) for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use, or
(iii) for the provision of services by that enterprise."

**Energy Sector Impact**: Marketing and trading structures:
- Local marketing subsidiary selling parent's crude production
- Local gas marketing entity marketing parent's gas production
- Equipment leasing structures

**2. Article 13 MLI - Artificial Avoidance Through Specific Activity Exemptions**

**Issue**: Fragmentation of activities to qualify for Article 5(4) exceptions:
- Separate entities for warehousing, purchasing, administration
- Each individually qualifies for preparatory/auxiliary exception
- Collectively constitute substantial business presence

**MLI Solution**:
- Article 5(4) exceptions apply only if activity preparatory or auxiliary in character (not automatic exemption)
- Anti-fragmentation rule: Exceptions denied if enterprise/related enterprises conduct complementary activities constituting cohesive business operation

**Energy Sector Impact**:
- Integrated supply chain activities (storage, distribution, sales)
- Separate procurement and operations entities
- Shared service centers

**3. Article 15 MLI - Definition of Person Closely Related to Enterprise**

For agency PE and anti-fragmentation rules, "closely related" means:
- One enterprise holds >50% beneficial interest in other
- Same persons hold >50% beneficial interest in both enterprises
- Consolidated financial statements

**Energy Sector**: Joint ventures, consortium arrangements, affiliated service providers

### 4.2 MLI Implementation Status (2023-2025)

**Participation**: Over 100 jurisdictions signed MLI:
- **Major energy producers**: Nigeria, Malaysia, Norway, UAE, Kazakhstan signed
- **Notable absences**: United States (not signatory), Brazil (signed but not ratified)
- **Effective dates**: Varies by contracting state combination (2018-2024 entry into force)

**Energy Sector Key Jurisdictions - MLI Status**:

| Jurisdiction | MLI Signatory | PE Provisions Adopted | Effective Dates |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **United Kingdom** | Yes | Yes (Art 12, 13, 15) | 2019 onwards |
| **Norway** | Yes | Yes (Art 12, 13, 15) | 2020 onwards |
| **Netherlands** | Yes | Yes (Art 12, 13, 15) | 2019 onwards |
| **Nigeria** | Yes | Yes (Art 12, 13, 15) | 2021 onwards |
| **Malaysia** | Yes | Partial | 2022 onwards |
| **UAE** | Yes | Yes (Art 12, 13, 15) | 2022 onwards |
| **United States** | No | N/A | N/A |
| **Brazil** | Signed, not ratified | Pending | Pending |

**Recent Treaty Developments (2023-2025)**:

**Digital Services and PE**: Growing focus on digital PE concepts:
- **OECD Pillar One**: Nexus based on revenue thresholds (€1M in market jurisdiction), not PE
- **Digital PE provisions**: Some treaties include specific digital services PE (India bilateral treaties)
- **Energy sector impact**: Digital oilfield services, remote operations, data analytics services

**Offshore Installations**: Clarifications in recent treaties:
- **Territorial scope**: Explicit inclusion of continental shelf and EEZ in treaty scope
- **Seabed activities**: Specific provisions for subsea operations
- **Flag state vs. coastal state**: Clarification of primary taxing rights

**Climate-Related Activities**: Novel issues for new treaties:
- **CO2 transport and storage**: PE status of CCS operations
- **Hydrogen production**: Offshore wind-to-hydrogen facilities
- **Decommissioning operations**: PE during platform removal and site restoration

### 4.3 Energy-Specific PE Developments

**Offshore Installation Guidance**:

**OECD Commentary 2017 Updates** on offshore installations:
- Article 5(2) "place of extraction" includes offshore wells/platforms from day one
- Mobile drilling rigs: Fixed place analysis - degree of permanence based on contract duration and operational reality
- Seismic vessels: Typically not PE unless treaty includes special provision or duration creates fixed place

**Drilling Rig PE Analysis** - Recent Cases and Administrative Guidance:

**Factors Determining Rig PE Status**:
1. **Contract duration**: Long-term contracts (>12 months) increase PE risk
2. **Geographic movement**: Rig operating within defined field vs. moving between multiple fields/countries
3. **Completion vs. exploration**: Well development creates stronger PE nexus than pure exploration
4. **Return pattern**: Rig returning repeatedly to same field/platform
5. **Mooring**: Permanently moored vs. dynamic positioning

**Recent Administrative Positions**:
- **Norway**: Drilling rigs on Norwegian continental shelf - PE from day one (strict interpretation)
- **UK**: HMRC guidance - drilling rigs may constitute PE depending on degree of permanence
- **Nigeria**: FIRS position - drilling activities create PE (service PE and/or construction PE)
- **Brazil**: Receita Federal - offshore rigs require case-by-case analysis (duration and fixation)

**Seismic Vessel PE**:
- **Generally**: Seismic vessels conducting surveys - mobile activities, no fixed place
- **Exception**: Long-term operations in defined area with regular pattern may create PE
- **Service PE exposure**: Many treaties include service PE catching seismic services exceeding time threshold

**FPSO (Floating Production, Storage, Offloading)**:
- **Production operations**: FPSO conducting production - Article 5(2) "place of extraction" PE from day one
- **Ownership**: FPSO owner (contractor) vs. oil company (charterer) - separate PE analysis
- **Lease vs. operation**: Passive leasing vs. operational services changes characterization

### 5.2 Comparative Analysis - OECD vs. UN Model PE Thresholds

| PE Category | OECD Model (2017) | UN Model (2021) | Typical Energy Treaty | Energy Sector Impact |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **General PE (Art 5(1))** | Fixed place of business | Fixed place of business | Same | High - production facilities |
| **Extraction (Art 5(2))** | Mine, oil/gas well, quarry - day one | Same | Same | **Critical** - immediate PE |
| **Construction PE (Art 5(3))** | >12 months | >6 months | 3-6 months common | High - LNG plants, pipelines |
| **Installation Projects** | >12 months (in construction) | >6 months | 3-6 months common | High - platforms, facilities |
| **Supervisory Activities** | Included in construction | Separate provision, >6 months | Often separate, 3-6 months | Medium - project supervision |
| **Service PE** | None (pre-2017) Commentary only | >183 days in 12 months (Art 5(3)(b)) | 90-183 days typical | **Critical** - seismic, drilling, technical services |
| **Agency PE (Art 5(5))** | Authority to conclude contracts (in name of) | Same + services provision | Often UN Model broader | Medium - marketing affiliates |
| **MLI Modified Agency** | Contracts routinely concluded, property transfer rights, services | N/A (MLI modifies bilateral treaties) | Varies by MLI adoption | High - commissionaires |
| **Independent Agent (Art 5(6))** | Exception if independent and ordinary course | Same + not wholly/almost wholly | MLI: exclusive activity loses exception | Medium - drilling contractors |
| **Preparatory/Auxiliary (Art 5(4))** | Per se exceptions (pre-BEPS) | Narrower exceptions | Varies | Medium - storage, offices |
| **MLI Modified Art 5(4)** | Must be preparatory/auxiliary in character + anti-fragmentation | N/A | Varies by MLI adoption | High - integrated operations |
| **Offshore Installations** | Commentary confirms Art 5(2) | Same | Often explicit territorial scope clauses | **Critical** - continental shelf |
| **Drilling Rigs** | Fixed place analysis (case-by-case) | Same | Often specific provisions | High - mobile vs. fixed |
| **Seismic Vessels** | Generally no PE (mobile) | Service PE may apply | Service PE threshold critical | High - survey operations |

**Key Observations for Energy Sector**:

1. **UN Model more favorable to source countries**: Lower thresholds for construction and service PE
2. **Bilateral treaties with developing countries**: Typically closer to UN Model (resource-rich countries negotiate stronger source taxation)
3. **MLI impact**: Significant expansion of PE definitions for adopting countries (agency PE and anti-fragmentation)
4. **Offshore specific provisions**: Modern treaties include explicit continental shelf and EEZ provisions

### 5.3 Profit Attribution Methodology - Practical Application

**Step-by-Step AOA Application**:

**Step 1: Determine PE Existence and Classification**
- Apply PE decision tree
- Identify specific PE provision triggered (Art 5(1), 5(2), 5(3), 5(5))
- Determine PE commencement and cessation dates

**Step 2: Functional and Factual Analysis**

**Functions**:
- Identify significant people functions
- Categorize: strategic, operational, support
- Determine where key entrepreneurial risk-taking decisions made

**Assets**:
- Tangible: Production facilities, equipment, inventory
- Intangible: Technology, contracts, licenses, data, know-how
- Financial: Cash, receivables, investments

**Risks**:
- Operational risks: Production, environmental, health & safety
- Market risks: Commodity price, demand
- Financial risks: Currency, interest rate, credit
- Regulatory/political risks: Contract stability, expropriation

**Step 3: Recognize Internal Dealings**

Identify notional transactions between PE and head office:
- Goods transfers: Crude oil, equipment, materials
- Services: Management, technical, administrative
- Financing: Loans, guarantees, capital
- Intangibles: License of technology, use of contracts

**Step 4: Apply Transfer Pricing Methods**

Select appropriate method:
- **CUP**: For commodity sales (crude oil - market price references)
- **Cost Plus**: For routine services (10-20% markup typical)
- **TNMM**: For integrated operations (benchmark net margin)
- **Profit Split**: For unique value chains with valuable intangibles both sides

**Step 5: Attribute Capital (Free Capital)**

Calculate appropriate equity capital for PE:
- **Regulatory minimum**: E&P industry often 30-40% equity ratio
- **Functional analysis**: Capital needed to support assets and risks
- **Comparables**: Standalone companies with similar functions
- **Thin capitalization**: Ensure compliance with domestic rules

**Step 6: Calculate Taxable Profit**

| Item | Calculation | Amount (USD) |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Revenue** | Production × market price OR service fees | X |
| **Less: Direct Costs** | OPEX, depreciation, personnel | (A) |
| **Less: Allocated Costs** | Head office services (arm's length) | (B) |
| **Less: Royalties** | Intangible usage (arm's length) | (C) |
| **Less: Interest** | Attributed debt × arm's length rate | (D) |
| **Taxable Profit** | X - A - B - C - D | **PROFIT** |

**Step 7: Apply Tax Rate**

Source country corporate tax × Taxable Profit = **PE Tax Liability**

**Step 8: Documentation**

Prepare PE-specific documentation:
- Functional analysis report
- Transfer pricing documentation
- Separate financial statements (management accounts)
- Tax return and supporting schedules

## 6. Worked Example 1: Seismic Vessel PE Determination with Profit Attribution

### Fact Pattern

**ArcticSeismic AS**, a Norwegian geophysical company, provides 3D seismic survey services offshore West Africa. ArcticSeismic enters into a contract with **GhanaPetro Ltd** (Ghanaian state oil company) to conduct seismic surveys in the Jubilee field offshore Ghana.

**Contract Terms**:
- **Scope**: 3D multi-azimuth seismic survey covering 2,500 sq km
- **Duration**: June 1, 2024 - November 30, 2024 (183 days)
- **Contract price**: USD 25 million (fixed fee)
- **Vessel**: M/V ArcticExplorer (Norwegian flag, custom-built seismic vessel)

**Operations**:
- Vessel operates continuously in Ghanaian territorial waters and EEZ (Jubilee field)
- 15 ArcticSeismic employees on vessel (geophysicists, data processors, crew)
- Data acquisition: June-October (153 days)
- Initial processing on board: October-November (30 days)
- Final processing and interpretation: Norway (after vessel departure)

**Ghana-Norway Tax Treaty**:
- **Article 5(2)**: Includes "mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or other place of extraction" - PE from day one
- **Article 5(3)**: Construction/installation project >120 days → PE
- **Article 5(3)(b) Service PE**: Services through employees >90 days in 12 months → PE
- **Article 7**: Business profits taxable only in Norway unless PE in Ghana
- **Ghana corporate tax rate**: 25%
- **Additional oil & gas tax**: 10% (total 35% effective rate)
- **Branch profit remittance tax**: 10% on after-tax profit

**ArcticSeismic Cost Structure**:
- Vessel operating costs (fuel, maintenance, crew): USD 12 million
- Geophysical personnel costs (15 employees, 6 months): USD 3 million
- Equipment depreciation (seismic equipment): USD 4 million
- Head office allocation (G&A, technology license): USD 2 million
- **Total costs**: USD 21 million

**Questions**:
1. Does ArcticSeismic have a PE in Ghana?
2. If PE exists, what profit is attributable to the PE?
3. Calculate Ghana tax liability.
4. What are the planning considerations?

### Analysis

**Question 1: PE Determination**

**Article 5(2) - Place of Extraction**:
- Issue: Is seismic vessel a "place of extraction of natural resources"?
- Analysis: Vessel not extracting resources; providing survey services to facilitate future extraction
- Conclusion: **Article 5(2) does not apply** (no extraction by ArcticSeismic)

**Article 5(3) - Construction/Installation PE**:
- Issue: Is seismic survey a "construction or installation project"?
- Analysis: Survey is technical service, not construction/installation of physical structures
- Treaty threshold: 120 days
- Duration: 183 days (exceeds threshold)
- Conclusion: **Arguable** whether seismic constitutes "installation" - some authorities treat seismic equipment deployment as installation; conservative approach: PE exists

**Article 5(3)(b) - Service PE**:
- Provision: Services through employees >90 days in 12 months
- Facts: 15 employees providing technical services for 183 days
- Conclusion: **Service PE clearly exists** (183 days > 90 day threshold)

**Article 5(1) - General PE**:
- Fixed place: Vessel operating in defined geographical area (Jubilee field)
- Degree of permanence: 183 consecutive days - sufficient temporal permanence
- Business carried on: Active seismic survey operations
- Conclusion: **General PE exists** (vessel constitutes fixed place)

**Article 5(4) - Preparatory/Auxiliary Exception**:
- Issue: Is seismic survey preparatory or auxiliary?
- Analysis: Seismic survey is ArcticSeismic's **core business** (not preparatory to its business); it is preparatory to GhanaPetro's exploration, but test applies to ArcticSeismic's business
- Conclusion: **Exception does not apply**

**Conclusion Question 1**: **PE exists** under:
- **Primary basis**: Article 5(3)(b) Service PE (clear application)
- **Alternative bases**: Article 5(1) General PE, Article 5(3) Construction PE (arguable)

**Question 2: Profit Attribution**

Apply **Article 7 AOA** to attribute profits to Ghana PE:

**Step 1: Functional Analysis**

**Functions performed in Ghana (by PE)**:
- Seismic data acquisition (core technical function)
- Onboard data processing (initial processing)
- Project management and coordination
- Health, safety, environment management

**Functions performed in Norway (by HO)**:
- Contract negotiation and management
- Final data processing and interpretation
- Technology development and IP ownership
- Corporate management and administration

**Assets used by PE**:
- Seismic vessel (tangible)
- Seismic equipment (streamers, air guns, positioning) (tangible)
- Proprietary acquisition software (intangible - licensed from HO)
- Personnel

**Risks assumed by PE**:
- Operational execution risk (weather, technical failure)
- HSE risks during operations
- Limited market risk (fixed price contract)

**Step 2: Recognize Internal Dealings**

**HO provides to PE**:
1. **Vessel and equipment**: Vessel made available to PE for 6-month project
   - Arm's length charge: Vessel day rate or asset depreciation allocation
   - Calculation: USD 4M depreciation attributable to PE operations (included in costs)

2. **Technology license**: Proprietary seismic acquisition and processing software
   - Arm's length charge: Royalty for software use
   - Benchmark: 5% of revenue for specialized software (industry benchmark)
   - Calculation: USD 25M × 5% = USD 1.25M

3. **Management services**: Corporate management, technology support, contract management
   - Arm's length charge: Cost plus markup
   - Benchmark: 10% markup on allocated costs
   - Calculation: USD 2M × 110% = USD 2.2M (total cost to PE)

**PE provides to HO**:
- Seismic data (raw and processed): Transferred to HO for final processing and delivery to client
- Value: Embedded in final contract price; no separate internal transfer charge (integrated project)

**Step 3: Profit Attribution Calculation**

| Item | Amount (USD) | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Contract Revenue** | 25,000,000 | Full revenue attributed to PE (operations in Ghana) |
| **Less: Direct Costs** | | |
| Vessel operating costs | (12,000,000) | Direct costs incurred by PE |
| Personnel costs | (3,000,000) | Direct costs incurred by PE |
| Equipment depreciation | (4,000,000) | Asset usage during PE operations |
| **Less: Internal Dealings** | | |
| Technology royalty to HO | (1,250,000) | 5% of revenue (arm's length) |
| Management services from HO | (2,200,000) | Allocated costs plus 10% markup |
| **Taxable Profit (PE)** | **2,550,000** | Profit attributable to Ghana PE |

**Effective Profit Margin**: 10.2% (2.55M / 25M) - reasonable for specialized technical services

**Validation**: TNMM benchmark for seismic survey services: 8-15% operating margin (comparable public companies). Attribution within arm's length range.

**Question 3: Ghana Tax Calculation**

| Tax Type | Calculation | Amount (USD) |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Corporate Tax (25%)** | 2,550,000 × 25% | 637,500 |
| **Additional Oil & Gas Tax (10%)** | 2,550,000 × 10% | 255,000 |
| **Subtotal Tax** | | 892,500 |
| **After-tax Profit** | 2,550,000 - 892,500 | 1,657,500 |
| **Branch Remittance Tax (10%)** | 1,657,500 × 10% | 165,750 |
| **Total Ghana Tax** | | **1,058,250** |
| **Net Profit to Norway** | 2,550,000 - 1,058,250 | 1,491,750 |

**Effective Tax Rate**: 41.5% (1,058,250 / 2,550,000)

**Double Tax Relief in Norway**:
- Norway taxes worldwide income but provides foreign tax credit
- Credit available: USD 1,058,250 (Ghana tax paid)
- Limitation: Lower of foreign tax paid or Norwegian tax on same income
- Norwegian rate: 22%
- Maximum credit: 2,550,000 × 22% = USD 561,000
- **Excess foreign tax credit**: USD 1,058,250 - 561,000 = USD 497,250 (not creditable - higher foreign tax)

**Question 4: Planning Considerations**

**Immediate Compliance**:
1. **PE registration**: Register PE with Ghana Revenue Authority within 30 days of threshold breach
2. **Tax filings**: File Ghana corporate tax returns (annual and potentially quarterly estimates)
3. **Transfer pricing documentation**: Prepare contemporaneous TP documentation for internal dealings
4. **Separate accounting**: Maintain PE-specific financial records

**Structural Planning for Future Projects**:

**Option 1: Duration Management**:
- **Strategy**: Structure contracts <90 days to avoid service PE
- **Implementation**: Conduct survey in multiple mobilizations; separate contracts per mobilization
- **Risk**: Tax authorities may aggregate related projects ("connected project" test)
- **Benefit**: Avoid PE entirely; tax only in Norway (Article 7(1))

**Option 2: Flag State Planning**:
- **Strategy**: Operate vessel under different flag jurisdiction with favorable treaty
- **Analysis**: Ghana treaty network varies; some treaties may have higher service PE thresholds
- **Example**: If vessel flagged in jurisdiction with Ghana treaty having 183-day service PE threshold, this project borderline
- **Limitation**: Vessel flag change involves significant maritime law and operational considerations

**Option 3: Subcontracting**:
- **Strategy**: ArcticSeismic subcontracts data acquisition to local Ghanaian contractor (independent)
- **Benefits**:
  - Local contractor PE is Ghanaian (not foreign PE issue)
  - ArcticSeismic provides equipment/technology but no employees in Ghana
  - ArcticSeismic role: Equipment rental + technology license (possibly Article 12 royalty treatment)
- **Risks**:
  - If subcontractor dependent agent → Agency PE (Article 5(5))
  - Substance requirements: Subcontractor must be genuinely independent
  - GhanaPetro may require ArcticSeismic direct performance (quality assurance)

**Option 4: Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)**:
- **Strategy**: Negotiate APA with Ghana Revenue Authority on profit attribution methodology
- **Benefits**:
  - Certainty on taxable profit calculation
  - Avoid transfer pricing disputes
  - Agreed methodology for future projects
- **Process**: 12-24 months to negotiate; requires disclosure of financial models and benchmarking

**Option 5: Offshore Holding Structure**:
- **Strategy**: Conduct operations through entity in jurisdiction with favorable Ghana treaty
- **Analysis**:
  - Netherlands: 10% dividend WHT; corporate tax 25.8%; service PE still 90 days
  - UK: Potentially favorable treaty terms; corporate tax 25%; service PE threshold varies
- **MLI Impact**: PPT and beneficial ownership tests would scrutinize structure lacking substance
- **Recommendation**: Not viable for project-based services without genuine operational presence

**Recommended Approach**:

For **isolated project**: Accept PE status and optimize profit attribution:
- Minimize attributable profit through legitimate functional analysis
- Technology royalty 5-8% to HO (benchmark and document)
- Management fee allocation (arm's length markup)
- Equipment charges (market-rate vessel day rates)
- Target 8-10% PE margin (low end of benchmark range, supportable)

For **ongoing Ghana presence**: Consider local subsidiary:
- Ghanaian company (not PE, but full Ghanaian company)
- Employs local staff, owns/leases local assets
- Potential benefits: Operational efficiency, local content requirements, PSC participation
- Tax comparison: Ghanaian company 35% rate same as PE effective rate; no incremental tax disadvantage

**Recommendation Summary**: **Accept PE status**; focus on defensible profit attribution at lower end of arm's length range (8-10% margin); prepare robust transfer pricing documentation; consider APA for future projects if ongoing Ghana operations expected.

## 7. Worked Example 2: Service PE with Treaty Analysis

### Fact Pattern

**TechDrill International Ltd** (TDI), a UK company, provides specialized directional drilling services to oil & gas operators worldwide. TDI owns proprietary drilling technology and employs highly skilled drilling engineers.

**2024 Malaysia Project**:
- **Client**: Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (Malaysian state oil company)
- **Contract**: Technical services contract for directional drilling expertise
- **Scope**: TDI provides 8 drilling engineers (rotational - 4 on-site at any time) to support Petronas drilling operations on 6 offshore wells (Sarawak, Malaysia)
- **Contract fee**: USD 10 million (fixed fee for entire project)
- **Contract period**: March 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024 (306 days)

**Personnel Presence in Malaysia**:
- Each engineer works 28 days on-site / 28 days off-site (rotation)
- 8 engineers total, 4 on-site at any time
- Total person-days in Malaysia: 8 engineers × (306 days / 2 rotations) = 1,224 person-days
- Physical presence days (any personnel present): 306 days continuously (March 1 - December 31)

**Operations**:
- Engineers based on drilling rigs (offshore - Malaysian continental shelf)
- No TDI office or facilities onshore in Malaysia
- Engineers use Petronas facilities and equipment
- TDI provides specialized technical expertise and proprietary software
- Petronas owns the drilling rigs and employs rig crews

**UK-Malaysia Tax Treaty (Simplified)**:
- **Article 5(1)**: Fixed place of business - general PE definition
- **Article 5(3)**: Building site or construction/installation project >9 months → PE
- **Article 5(3A) Service PE**: "Furnishing of services including consultancy services through employees or other personnel for the same or connected project for >90 days in any 12-month period" → PE
- **Article 7**: Business profits taxable only in UK unless PE in Malaysia
- **Malaysia corporate tax rate**: 24%
- **Petroleum income tax**: 38% (for petroleum operations - may not apply to service provider PE)

**TDI Cost Structure**:
- Engineer salaries and benefits (8 engineers, 10 months): USD 4 million
- Mobilization and logistics: USD 1 million
- Software license fees (to TDI UK HO - proprietary drilling software): USD 1.5 million
- UK head office allocation (management, technology development, training): USD 1.5 million
- **Total costs**: USD 8 million
- **Gross profit**: USD 10M - 8M = USD 2 million (20% margin)

**Malaysian Tax Authority Position**:
- Service PE exists (>90 days)
- Full contract revenue attributable to Malaysia PE
- Taxable profit: USD 2 million
- Tax assessment: USD 2M × 24% = USD 480,000

**TDI Position**:
- No PE exists (no fixed place; personnel on client facilities)
- Alternatively, if PE exists, limited profit attributable (most value created in UK through technology)

**Questions**:
1. Does TDI have a PE in Malaysia under Article 5?
2. If PE exists, what is the correct profit attribution?
3. What is the tax treatment of the software license fees?
4. What are the planning alternatives?

### Analysis

**Question 1: PE Existence Analysis**

**Article 5(3A) - Service PE**:

**Provision**: Services through employees >90 days in 12-month period

**Duration Calculation - Two Possible Methods**:

**Method 1: Physical Presence Days** (any TDI personnel present in Malaysia):
- March 1 - December 31, 2024: **306 days** continuously
- Conclusion: **>90 days** → Service PE exists

**Method 2: Aggregate Person-Days**:
- Total person-days: 1,224 days (but not the correct calculation for service PE)
- Service PE measures project duration, not person-days
- Conclusion: Method 1 correct; Method 2 not applicable to service PE test

**Correct Duration**: **306 days** (entire period when services provided, regardless of rotation)

**"Same or connected project"**: Single contract for 6 wells - clearly same project

**"Through employees"**: TDI engineers are employees - requirement satisfied

**Conclusion - Article 5(3A)**: **Service PE exists** (306 days > 90 days threshold)

**Article 5(1) - General PE**:

**Fixed place of business**:
- Issue: TDI has no office, warehouse, or owned/leased facilities in Malaysia
- Engineers based on Petronas drilling rigs (not TDI's facilities)
- Case law: *Dudney* (UK), *Klaus Becker* (CJEU) - temporary use of client facilities may not constitute fixed place at enterprise's disposal

**Geographic fixation**:
- Drilling rigs: Mobile (move between well locations)
- Multiple rigs over 10-month period
- No single fixed geographic location

**Temporal permanence**:
- 306 days total
- But no single location for sufficient duration

**Conclusion - Article 5(1)**: **General PE questionable** (no fixed place at TDI's disposal; client facilities; mobile locations)

**Article 5(3) - Construction PE**:

**Provision**: Building site, construction, installation project >9 months

**Is drilling service a "construction or installation project"?**:
- Drilling creates wells (installation of well infrastructure)
- OECD Commentary: Drilling may constitute installation
- 306 days = 10 months > 9 month threshold

**Conclusion - Article 5(3)**: **Arguable PE** (drilling may be "installation"; threshold exceeded)

**Determination**: **PE exists** under Article 5(3A) Service PE (clear); Article 5(3) Construction PE (arguable); Article 5(1) General PE (unlikely).

**Question 2: Profit Attribution**

**Article 7 AOA Application**:

**Step 1: Functional Analysis**

**Functions in Malaysia (PE)**:
- On-site technical drilling services
- Real-time drilling parameter optimization
- Directional drilling expertise
- Problem-solving and technical support

**Functions in UK (HO)**:
- Contract negotiation and client relationship
- Technology development (proprietary software)
- Engineer recruitment, training, and management
- Project planning and design
- Corporate management and administration

**Assets - PE vs. HO**:

| Asset Type | Location | Ownership | Attribution |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Drilling rigs** | Malaysia | Petronas (client) | Not TDI asset |
| **Drilling equipment** | Malaysia | Petronas (client) | Not TDI asset |
| **Proprietary software** | Used in Malaysia | TDI UK (HO) | HO asset, licensed to PE |
| **Technical know-how** | Embodied in engineers | TDI UK (developed) | HO asset, deployed via PE |
| **Engineers** | Malaysia (rotational) | TDI employees | PE human capital |

**Risks**:
- **Execution risk**: PE bears (on-site performance)
- **Technical risk**: Shared (HO technology + PE application)
- **Commercial risk**: HO bears (contract negotiation, client credit risk)
- **Market risk**: HO bears (pricing, demand)

**Conclusion**: **HO performs high-value functions** (technology development, contract acquisition); **PE performs execution functions** (application of HO-developed expertise)

**Step 2: Internal Dealings**

**HO provides to PE**:
1. **Technology license**: Proprietary drilling software and methodologies
   - Arm's length charge: Royalty
   - Benchmark: Technology royalties in oil services industry: 15-25% of revenue for specialized technology
   - Conservative approach: 15%
   - Calculation: USD 10M × 15% = **USD 1.5M**

2. **Trained personnel**: Engineers trained in TDI proprietary techniques
   - Cost: USD 4M (engineer salaries)
   - Markup: Personnel provided at cost plus 10% (cost-plus benchmark for personnel secondment)
   - Calculation: USD 4M × 110% = **USD 4.4M**

3. **Management and support services**: Contract management, project planning, corporate support
   - Allocated cost: USD 1.5M
   - Markup: 10%
   - Calculation: USD 1.5M × 110% = **USD 1.65M**

**Total internal charges**: 1.5M + 4.4M + 1.65M = **USD 7.55M**

**Step 3: PE Profit Calculation - HO Perspective**

| Item | Amount (USD) | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Contract Revenue** | 10,000,000 | Full revenue |
| **Less: Direct Costs** | | |
| Engineer costs | (4,000,000) | Salaries and benefits |
| Mobilization/logistics | (1,000,000) | Direct project costs |
| **Gross Profit** | 5,000,000 | |
| **Less: HO Costs** | | |
| Technology development | Allocated via royalty | See internal dealings |
| HO management | (1,500,000) | Allocated costs |
| **Pre-attribution profit** | 3,500,000 | Total TDI profit pool |

**Step 4: PE Profit Attribution - AOA Approach**

**Method A: Direct Allocation Based on Functions**

Attribution to **PE** (on-site execution):
- Revenue attributable: USD 10M (all operations in Malaysia)
- Direct costs: USD 4M (engineers) + 1M (mobilization) = USD 5M
- Technology royalty to HO: USD 1.5M (15% of revenue)
- Management services from HO: USD 1.65M
- **PE Profit**: 10M - 5M - 1.5M - 1.65M = **USD 1.85M**
- **PE Margin**: 18.5%

Attribution to **HO** (technology, contract acquisition):
- Technology royalty received from PE: USD 1.5M
- Management fee received from PE: USD 1.65M
- Less: HO costs (1.5M) = USD 0.15M
- **HO Profit**: USD 1.65M (includes technology value)

**Total**: 1.85M + 1.65M = 3.5M ✓ (reconciles to total profit pool)

**Method B: TNMM Benchmark (Alternative Check)**

Comparable companies providing oilfield technical services (PE function):
- Operating margin: 12-20% range
- Median: 15%

TDI PE margin: 18.5% - **within arm's length range** ✓

**Method C: Profit Split (Alternative)**

If technology and execution equally critical:
- Total profit: USD 3.5M
- PE share (50%): USD 1.75M
- HO share (50%): USD 1.75M

**Comparison**: Direct allocation (1.85M) vs. Profit split (1.75M) - close results validate attribution

**Recommended Attribution**: **Method A (USD 1.85M)** - most aligned with functional analysis and AOA principles

**Question 3: Software License Fee Treatment**

**Issue**: USD 1.5M technology royalty - tax characterization

**Analysis**:

**Article 12 (Royalties)** vs. **Article 7 (Business Profits)**:

**UK-Malaysia Treaty Article 12** (typical provision):
- Royalties for use of copyright, patent, trademark, know-how: Withholding tax in source state
- Typical rate: 10% (standard UK-Malaysia treaty rate)
- Definition: "Payments for use of, or right to use" intellectual property

**Internal Royalty (HO to PE)**:
- **Legal fiction**: PE is not separate legal entity; no actual payment (same legal entity)
- **Tax treatment**: For PE profit attribution, royalty recognized as internal dealing
- **No withholding tax**: No actual cross-border payment; internal allocation only
- **Effect**: Reduces PE taxable profit; increases HO profit (same entity, both reflected in consolidated accounts)

**If HO licensed technology to third-party Malaysian entity** (hypothetical):
- Article 12 royalty treatment
- Malaysia withholding tax: 10% × 1.5M = USD 150K
- UK credit for foreign tax

**Conclusion**: Internal royalty **not subject to Article 12** (not actual payment); treated as **profit attribution mechanism under Article 7**.

**Question 4: Planning Alternatives**

**Alternative 1: Shorten Contract Duration**

**Strategy**: Structure contract <90 days to avoid service PE threshold

**Implementation**:
- Phase 1: 89 days (just under threshold)
- Gap: 60+ days gap
- Phase 2: Separate contract, 89 days
- Approach: Avoid PE entirely

**Risks**:
- **Connected project test**: Tax authorities may aggregate if commercially/functionally connected
- **Substance**: Artificial splitting for tax purposes (PPT risk if MLI applies)
- **Client requirements**: Petronas may require single continuous contract

**Assessment**: **High risk** of aggregation; not recommended unless genuine commercial separation

**Alternative 2: Subcontracting to Malaysian Entity**

**Strategy**: TDI establishes Malaysian subsidiary; subsidiary provides services to Petronas

**Structure**:
- TDI Malaysia Sdn Bhd (Malaysian company, 100% owned by TDI UK)
- Malaysian company employs engineers (local or expatriate)
- Malaysian company contracts with Petronas
- TDI UK licenses technology to TDI Malaysia (arm's length royalty)

**Tax implications**:
- **No PE issue**: Malaysian company, not foreign PE
- **Malaysian corporate tax**: 24% on profits (same rate as PE)
- **Royalty to UK**: Subject to Article 12 withholding (10%)
- **Profit repatriation**: Dividend from Malaysia to UK (0% under treaty if >25% holding)

**Cost-benefit**:
- Incorporation and ongoing costs: USD 50-100K annually
- No tax savings (24% rate same; additional 10% royalty WHT)
- Benefits: Operational presence, local content compliance, future business development

**Assessment**: **Viable if long-term Malaysian presence expected**; minimal tax benefit but operational advantages

**Alternative 3: Independent Contractor Model**

**Strategy**: Engineers engaged as independent contractors (not employees)

**Analysis**:
- **Service PE provision**: "Through employees or other personnel"
- **"Other personnel"**: Commentary suggests independent contractors included if economically dependent
- **Risk**: Tax authorities likely treat independent contractors as "other personnel" for service PE
- **Additional risk**: Employment law reclassification (contractors actually employees)

**Assessment**: **Not effective** for avoiding service PE; creates employment law risk

**Alternative 4: Optimize Profit Attribution**

**Strategy**: Accept PE; minimize attributable profit through legitimate functional analysis

**Implementation**:
- **Increase technology royalty**: 20% instead of 15% (still within arm's length range)
  - Royalty: USD 10M × 20% = USD 2M
  - Reduces PE profit to: 10M - 5M - 2M - 1.65M = USD 1.35M
  - Malaysian tax: 1.35M × 24% = USD 324K (vs. USD 444K at 1.85M)
  - Savings: USD 120K

- **Increase HO service charges**: Comprehensive management fee 20% of revenue
  - Management fee: USD 10M × 20% = USD 2M
  - Reduces PE profit to: 10M - 5M - 1.5M - 2M = USD 1.5M
  - Malaysian tax: 1.5M × 24% = USD 360K

- **Risk**: Transfer pricing challenge if allocations exceed arm's length range
- **Documentation**: Robust TP documentation essential

**Assessment**: **Recommended approach** - optimize within arm's length range; well-documented functional analysis supporting higher HO allocations

**Alternative 5: Treaty Country Holding Structure**

**Strategy**: Operate through entity in jurisdiction with higher Malaysia service PE threshold

**Analysis**:
- Singapore-Malaysia treaty: Service PE threshold often 183 days
- Netherlands-Malaysia treaty: Service PE provisions vary
- **Issue**: This project 306 days exceeds most treaty thresholds
- **MLI/PPT**: Structure requires genuine substance and business purpose

**Assessment**: **Not effective** for this project duration; consider for shorter projects

**Recommended Overall Strategy**:

**Short term (this project)**:
1. Accept service PE status (clear under 306 days)
2. Optimize profit attribution:
   - Technology royalty: 18% of revenue (USD 1.8M)
   - Management fee: Cost plus 15% markup
   - Target PE margin: 12-15% (low end of benchmark range)
   - Result: PE profit ~USD 1.3-1.5M; Malaysian tax ~USD 310-360K

3. Prepare robust documentation:
   - Functional analysis (PE vs. HO)
   - Technology valuation and royalty benchmarking
   - Management services documentation
   - PE financial statements

**Long term (future Malaysia presence)**:
1. If ongoing Malaysian operations expected: Establish Malaysian subsidiary
2. Benefits: Operational efficiency, local content, future contract bidding
3. Structure: TDI Malaysia Sdn Bhd; TDI UK licenses technology (arm's length)

**Recommendation Summary**: **Accept PE status**; focus on defensible profit attribution with robust TP documentation maximizing legitimate HO allocations; establish Malaysian subsidiary if long-term presence planned.

## 8. Recent Developments and Emerging Issues (2023-2025)

### 8.1 OECD Pillar One and PE

**Two-Pillar Solution** (OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework, 2021; ongoing implementation):

**Pillar One - Amount A**: New nexus and profit allocation rules for largest MNEs (>EUR 20B revenue):
- Revenue threshold in market jurisdiction: EUR 1M (>EUR 250K for smaller jurisdictions)
- **Not based on PE**: New taxing right independent of physical presence
- **Energy sector**: Limited application (most energy companies below EUR 20B threshold; natural resources excluded)

**Pillar One - Amount B**: Baseline marketing and distribution returns (transfer pricing simplification):
- Standardized return for baseline marketing/distribution functions
- **Energy sector relevance**: Marketing affiliates and distributors (crude, LNG marketing)

**Impact on PE**: Pillar One creates parallel taxing right; does not replace PE threshold for business profits under treaties

**Energy Sector Position**: Most energy companies **below Pillar One thresholds** or in **excluded sectors** (extractives); traditional PE rules remain primary nexus test

### 8.2 Digital Services and Remote Operations

**Digital PE Concepts**: Some jurisdictions introduce "significant economic presence" (SEP) or digital PE:
- **India**: Significant economic presence thresholds (revenue or user-based)
- **Nigeria**: SEP introduced 2020 (not yet fully implemented)
- **OECD**: No consensus on digital PE (addressed through Pillar One instead)

**Energy Sector Digital Services**:
- **Remote monitoring**: Production facilities monitored from foreign control centers
- **Integrated operations centers**: Offshore platforms operated remotely
- **Data analytics**: Reservoir management and optimization services provided remotely
- **Question**: Do digital services create PE?

**Current Position**:
- **Traditional PE tests still apply**: Remote services generally do not create PE (no fixed place in source country)
- **Service PE exception**: If remote personnel not physically present in source state, service PE thresholds not triggered
- **Emerging risk**: Source countries may argue remote operations constitute PE if significant and sustained

**Planning Consideration**: Energy companies should monitor SEP developments; remote operations currently low PE risk under traditional treaty rules

### 8.3 Energy Transition Activities - Novel PE Issues

**Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**:
- **CO2 injection wells**: PE under Article 5(2) "place of extraction"? Or new category?
- **Pipeline transport**: CO2 pipelines - PE along route?
- **Storage reservoirs**: Geological storage - PE at reservoir location?

**Current analysis**: No clear guidance; likely treated analogously to traditional petroleum operations (PE at injection/storage location)

**Hydrogen Production**:
- **Offshore wind-to-hydrogen**: Production facilities on offshore platforms
- **Export pipelines**: Hydrogen transport infrastructure
- **PE treatment**: Likely Article 5(2) production facility PE from day one

**Offshore Renewable Energy**:
- **Wind farms**: Fixed installations - Article 5(1) general PE
- **Floating wind**: Mobile vs. fixed analysis
- **Construction**: Installation vessels and projects - Article 5(3) construction PE

**Decommissioning Operations**:
- **Platform removal**: Construction PE (>12 months projects)
- **Site restoration**: Duration and PE exposure
- **Question**: PE continues during decommissioning or ceases when production stops?

**Position**: Decommissioning likely creates separate PE exposure (construction activity); original production PE ceases when production stops

### 8.4 Administrative and Compliance Developments

**CbCR (Country-by-Country Reporting)**:
- MNEs >EUR 750M revenue: Annual CbCR filing
- **Includes**: Revenue, profit, tax, employees, assets by jurisdiction
- **PE disclosure**: PEs included in jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction reporting
- **Energy sector**: Most major IOCs subject to CbCR

**Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI)**:
- CRS (Common Reporting Standard): Financial account information exchange
- **PE bank accounts**: Reported to PE state and residence state
- **Transparency**: Increased visibility of PE activities and financial flows

**DAC6 (EU Mandatory Disclosure - Directive 2018/822)**:
- **Hallmarks**: Reportable cross-border arrangements (including PE avoidance structures)
- **Energy sector**: Commissionaire arrangements, fragmentation structures subject to reporting
- **Effective**: 2020 (retroactive to 2018); ongoing compliance requirement

**BEPS 2.0 Implementation Timeline**:
- **Pillar Two (Global Minimum Tax)**: 15% minimum effective tax rate (2024+ implementation)
- **PE implications**: PE jurisdictions with <15% rate may face top-up tax
- **Energy sector**: Low-tax jurisdictions (UAE, Qatar pre-2023 tax introduction) - monitor developments

## 1. Introduction

**1.1 The SPA as the Central Transaction Document**

The **Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA)** is the definitive legal contract governing an oil and gas M&A transaction. While tax advisors focus on structuring the optimal transaction, the SPA translates that structure into enforceable legal obligations, allocating risks, warranties, and liabilities between buyer and seller.

For tax professionals, the SPA is critical because it:
- **Allocates purchase price** among assets (affecting depreciation, depletion, and goodwill)
- **Apportions tax liabilities** between pre-closing and post-closing periods
- **Assigns responsibility** for tax audits, refunds, and contingencies
- **Defines indemnification** mechanisms for tax-related breaches
- **Structures payment terms** (affecting timing of income/deductions)

**1.2 Advanced Syllabus Level (Level 3)**

As an **advanced-level topic** (Level 3), candidates must demonstrate **detailed practical understanding** of:

- Key SPA provisions affecting tax outcomes
- Tax warranty and indemnity clauses
- Purchase price mechanisms and adjustment clauses
- Treatment of deferred consideration and earnouts
- Tax covenant structures
- Cross-border SPA complexities

Past exam questions require candidates to **draft provisions**, **analyze risk allocation**, and **recommend optimal contractual structures**.

## 2. Essential SPA Structure and Tax Provisions

**2.1 Core Components of an Oil & Gas SPA**

A typical SPA comprises:

**2.1.1 Preliminary Sections**
- **Recitals**: Background and transaction intent
- **Definitions and Interpretation**: Key terms (Completion, Effective Date, Tax, Accounts)
- **Conditions Precedent**: Government approvals, regulatory consents, financing conditions

**2.1.2 Commercial Terms**
- **Sale and Purchase**: Description of assets/shares being transferred
- **Purchase Price**: Total consideration and payment mechanics
- **Purchase Price Adjustment**: Economic balance mechanisms (Working Capital, Cost Pool adjustments)
- **Completion**: Mechanics of closing and transfer

**2.1.3 Warranties and Indemnities**
- **Warranties**: Seller's representations about the business, assets, liabilities
- **Tax Warranties**: Specific representations about tax compliance, returns, liabilities
- **Indemnities**: Compensation for specified losses (including tax liabilities)
- **Limitations**: Caps, baskets, time limits on claims

**2.1.4 Post-Completion Obligations**
- **Covenants**: Ongoing obligations (non-compete, cooperation on tax audits)
- **Tax Covenants**: Specific tax-related undertakings
- **Dispute Resolution**: Arbitration, jurisdiction clauses

**2.2 Purchase Price and Allocation Clauses**

**2.2.1 Purchase Price Determination**

**Fixed Price vs. Adjustable Price:**

**Fixed Price Structure:**
```
"The purchase price for the Shares shall be $500,000,000 (five hundred million US dollars),
payable in immediately available funds on Completion."
```

**Advantages:**
- Certainty for both parties
- Simpler documentation
- Faster completion

**Disadvantages:**
- Buyer bears risk of adverse changes between signing and closing
- Seller misses upside from favorable developments

**Adjustable Price Structure:**
```
"The Purchase Price shall be calculated as:

Base Price: $500,000,000

Plus/Minus:
(a) Working Capital Adjustment (to bring Working Capital to Target level of $50M)
(b) Net Debt Adjustment (actual Net Debt less Target Net Debt of $0)
(c) Leakage Adjustment (unauthorized distributions to seller post-signing)

Final Purchase Price = Base Price ± Adjustments"
```

**Tax Implications:**
- **Timing of consideration**: When is purchase price "fixed" for tax purposes (signing vs. completion)?
- **Deferred consideration**: Earnouts and contingent payments trigger installment sale rules or deferred income recognition
- **Adjustments**: Post-completion price adjustments may require amended tax returns

**2.2.2 Purchase Price Allocation (Asset Deals)**

For **asset purchases**, SPA must allocate total consideration among asset classes:

**Sample Allocation Clause:**
```
"Schedule 5 sets forth the Parties' agreement on allocation of the Purchase Price among the
Purchased Assets as follows:

Asset Class                         Allocated Value
------------------------------------------------------
Land and Surface Rights            $ 5,000,000
Buildings and Facilities           $ 40,000,000
Drilling Equipment                 $ 75,000,000
Production Equipment               $100,000,000
Gathering Systems                  $ 60,000,000
Petroleum Licenses                 $120,000,000
Proven Developed Reserves (PDP)    $180,000,000
Proven Undeveloped Reserves (PUD)  $ 80,000,000
Seismic and G&G Data               $ 10,000,000
Goodwill and Going Concern Value   $ 30,000,000
------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                              $700,000,000

The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with this allocation and
to take no position contrary to this allocation unless required by applicable Law or final
determination by a Tax Authority."
```

**Tax Significance:**
- **Binding on both parties**: Prevents disputes if IRS/HMRC challenges allocation
- **Determines depreciation/amortization**: Equipment (7-year) vs. goodwill (15-year)
- **Affects seller's recapture income**: Equipment allocation triggers Section 1245 recapture

**Best Practice:**
- Obtain **independent valuation report** supporting allocation
- Ensure allocation reflects **fair market value** of each asset class
- Consider **tax-efficient weighting** (favor shorter-lived assets for buyer, capital gain assets for seller)

## 3. Tax Warranties

**3.1 Purpose and Scope**

**Tax warranties** are **seller's representations** about the tax affairs of the target company or assets. They serve to:

- **Provide comfort** to buyer about historical tax compliance
- **Allocate risk** of unknown tax liabilities discovered post-closing
- **Create indemnification rights** if warranties prove false

**3.2 Typical Tax Warranty Provisions**

**3.2.1 Core Tax Warranties**

```
"The Seller warrants to the Buyer that:

(a) Tax Compliance
    All Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company have been timely
    filed, are accurate and complete, and all Taxes shown as due have been fully paid.

(b) No Tax Audits or Disputes
    There are no ongoing audits, investigations, or disputes with any Tax Authority, nor
    has the Seller received notice of any proposed or threatened assessment or claim.

(c) No Tax Liabilities
    The Company has no liability for Taxes other than (i) accruals reflected in the
    Completion Accounts, and (ii) Taxes arising in the ordinary course of business
    relating to periods after the Accounts Date.

(d) Tax Losses and Reliefs
    Schedule 8 accurately sets forth all available Tax loss carryforwards, capital
    allowances, and other Tax reliefs. Such reliefs are not subject to restriction or
    challenge.

(e) Transfer Taxes
    No stamp duty, transfer tax, VAT, or similar Tax arises on the sale of the Shares,
    other than [specified amounts to be borne by Buyer/Seller].

(f) Transfer Pricing Compliance
    All intercompany transactions have been conducted on arm's length terms in compliance
    with applicable transfer pricing rules, and the Company has maintained contemporaneous
    documentation.

(g) Withholding Tax Compliance
    The Company has complied with all withholding tax obligations and remitted all amounts
    required to be withheld.

(h) PSC Cost Oil Compliance [for PSC regimes]
    All costs claimed as recoverable cost oil under the Production Sharing Contract are
    proper, allowable costs in accordance with the PSC and applicable law. No costs have
    been disallowed or are subject to dispute with the Host Government."
```

**3.2.2 Seller's Negotiating Position**

Sellers seek to **limit warranties** through:

**Knowledge Qualifications:**
```
"To the best of the Seller's knowledge, information and belief, having made reasonable
enquiries of the Company's CFO and Tax Director..."
```

**Effect**: Seller not liable if warranty breach results from matters **unknown** to specified individuals.

**Materiality Thresholds:**
```
"All Tax Returns have been filed, except where failure to file would not result in liability
exceeding $100,000 individually or $500,000 in aggregate."
```

**Disclosure Schedules:**
```
"Except as disclosed in Schedule 10 (Tax Disclosures)..."
```

**Effect**: Matters disclosed in schedules are **excluded** from warranty coverage (buyer deemed to accept those risks).

**3.3 Tax Warranty Claims and Remedies**

**3.3.1 Limitations on Claims**

**Time Limits:**
```
"Claims for breach of Tax Warranties must be notified within:
(a) 7 years from Completion for Tax Warranties relating to fraud or willful misconduct
(b) [Shorter period after expiration of applicable statute of limitations] for other Tax Warranties
(c) 18 months from Completion for all other Warranties"
```

**Rationale**: Tax audit period typically 3-6 years; buyer should discover tax issues within limitation period.

**De Minimis Threshold (Basket):**
```
"The Seller shall have no liability for Warranty Claims unless and until the aggregate amount
of all such claims exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket"), whereupon the Seller shall be liable
for all amounts in excess of the Basket."
```

**Alternative - Tipping Basket:**
```
"...whereupon the Seller shall be liable for the full amount of all claims (including amounts
below the Basket)."
```

**Cap on Liability:**
```
"The Seller's aggregate liability for all Warranty Claims shall not exceed $50,000,000 (being
10% of the Purchase Price), except for claims relating to fraud or breach of Tax Warranties,
which shall be capped at 100% of the Purchase Price."
```

**Tax Covenant Claims** (discussed below) are typically **uncapped** and **outside the basket**.

(b) The refund relates to a Tax payment made by the Buyer or the Company post-Completion."
```

**Tax Benefit Reduction:**
```
"The amount payable by the Seller under this Tax Indemnity shall be reduced by the amount
of any actual Tax benefit realized by the Buyer or the Company as a result of the matter
giving rise to the indemnity (e.g., increased depreciation from higher basis, utilization
of NOLs)."
```

## 5. Special Provisions for Oil & Gas Transactions

**5.1 Effective Date and Economic Risk Allocation**

**5.1.1 Effective Date Clause**

```
"Notwithstanding the Completion Date, the economic benefits and burdens of ownership of the
Assets shall be deemed to transfer to the Buyer with effect from 00:01 hours on January 1,
2024 (the "Effective Date").

All production revenues, operating costs, and capital expenditures attributable to periods
on or after the Effective Date shall be for the account of the Buyer, and those attributable

## 6. Worked Examples

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Purchase Price Adjustment for Working Capital

**Facts:**

Buyer and Seller enter into an SPA for the sale of 100% shares in Target Oil Ltd.

**SPA Terms:**
- **Base Purchase Price**: $400 million
- **Target Working Capital**: $30 million (defined as Current Assets less Current Liabilities, excluding cash and debt)
- **Completion Date**: March 31, Year 1
- **Economic Effective Date**: January 1, Year 1

**Completion Accounts show:**
- Current Assets: $85 million (including $20M cash)
- Current Liabilities: $60 million (including $15M short-term debt)
- **Actual Working Capital** (excluding cash and debt): $85M - $20M - ($60M - $15M) = **$40 million**

**Net Debt** (defined as Debt less Cash):
- Debt: $15 million
- Cash: $20 million
- **Net Cash Position**: $5 million (i.e., Net Debt = -$5M)

**Target Net Debt in SPA: $0** (assumed debt-free, cash-free basis)

**Leakage**: Seller paid a **$3 million dividend** to its shareholders on February 15, Year 1 (between Effective Date and Completion), not in ordinary course of business.

**Required:**

1. Calculate the **Working Capital Adjustment**
2. Calculate the **Net Debt Adjustment**
3. Calculate the **Leakage Adjustment**
4. Determine the **Final Purchase Price**
5. Explain tax implications of adjustments

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Working Capital Adjustment**

**Formula:**
```
WC Adjustment = Actual WC - Target WC
              = $40M - $30M
              = +$10 million (in favor of Seller, because WC exceeds target)
```

**Interpretation:** Seller delivered $10M more working capital than agreed. Buyer pays additional $10M.

**Part 2: Net Debt Adjustment**

**Formula:**
```
Net Debt Adjustment = Target Net Debt - Actual Net Debt
                    = $0 - (-$5M)
                    = +$5 million (in favor of Seller)
```

**Interpretation:** Company has $5M **net cash** (no debt), which is $5M better than the "debt-free, cash-free" target. Buyer pays additional $5M for the excess cash.

**Part 3: Leakage Adjustment**

**Leakage** = Unauthorized distributions between Effective Date and Completion
= **$3 million dividend**

```
Leakage Adjustment = -$3 million (in favor of Buyer)
```

**Interpretation:** Seller extracted value through dividend, reducing company value. Purchase price reduced by $3M.

**Part 4: Final Purchase Price**

```
Base Purchase Price              $400.0M
Plus: WC Adjustment               +10.0M
Plus: Net Debt Adjustment          +5.0M
Less: Leakage Adjustment           -3.0M
--------------------------------------
Final Purchase Price             $412.0M
```

**Seller receives $412 million** (compared to $400M base price).

**Part 5: Tax Implications**

**For Seller:**
- **Taxable gain** calculated on final purchase price of **$412M** (not base $400M)
- **Dividend leakage** ($3M) was already taxable to shareholders when paid (double hit: reduces price and already taxed)
- If share sale, capital gains tax on $412M less basis in shares

**For Buyer:**
- **Basis in shares**: **$412M** for tax purposes
- **No step-up** in underlying assets (share purchase)
- **Working capital adjustment** does not change basis allocation (basis remains in shares)

**Accounting:**
- Adjustments are post-closing true-ups, not separate assets/liabilities
- Final consideration of $412M is recorded as investment in Target

**Timing:**
- Adjustments typically finalized 30-60 days after Completion (when Completion Accounts are prepared and agreed)
- **Tax reporting**: Buyer reports basis as **$412M** in the tax year of Completion (even if adjustment settled later)

═══════════════════════════════════════════

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2: Tax Warranty Breach and Indemnity Claim

**Facts:**

Buyer acquired Target Oil Corp for **$300 million** on June 30, Year 1. The SPA contained standard tax warranties and indemnities.

**Tax Warranty Provision:**
```
"Seller warrants that all Tax Returns have been filed and all Taxes shown as due have been
fully paid. There are no ongoing audits or disputes with any Tax Authority."
```

**Tax Indemnity:**
```
"Seller shall indemnify Buyer for all Pre-Completion Tax Liabilities, subject to:
- Basket: $500,000 (tipping basket)
- Cap: $30M (10% of purchase price)
- Time limit: 6 years from Completion"
```

**Post-Closing Developments:**

**Year 2:** Tax authority commences audit of Target's Year -2 to Year 0 tax returns (pre-acquisition years).

**Year 3:** Tax authority issues **assessment** for **$8 million** additional tax, comprising:

| Item | Amount | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| **Transfer Pricing Adjustment** | $5.0M | Intercompany service fees to Seller's affiliate disallowed as not arm's length |
| **Depreciation Disallowance** | $2.0M | Immediate expensing of certain items should have been capitalized |
| **Penalties and Interest** | $1.0M | Late payment penalties |
| **Total Assessment** | **$8.0M** | |

**Buyer's Costs:**
- Tax advisors' fees defending audit: **$300,000**
- Legal fees challenging assessment: **$200,000**

**Buyer settles with tax authority** for **$6.5 million** (original $8M less $1.5M negotiated reduction).

**Discovery:** During due diligence, Seller's **Disclosure Schedule** stated: *"No ongoing audits"*. However, Buyer later discovers Seller had received a **preliminary inquiry letter** from the tax authority 2 months before signing, asking for information on transfer pricing. Seller did not disclose this.

**Required:**

1. Determine if Seller **breached the Tax Warranty**
2. Calculate Buyer's **indemnity claim** amount
3. Assess whether claim is subject to **basket, cap, and time limits**
4. Analyze Buyer's recovery position
5. Discuss tax treatment of indemnity payment

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Tax Warranty Breach**

**Warranty:** *"There are no ongoing audits or disputes with any Tax Authority."*

**Facts:** Seller received inquiry letter before signing, which typically constitutes commencement of an audit or at least a "matter in the contemplation" of the tax authority.

**Conclusion:** Seller **breached the Tax Warranty** by:
- Failing to disclose the inquiry letter
- Representing "no ongoing audits" when audit was commencing

**Breach Implications:**
- Buyer entitled to **damages for breach of warranty** (difference in value)
- **Plus** indemnity for the actual tax liability (dollar-for-dollar)

**Part 2: Indemnity Claim Calculation**

**Indemnifiable Amounts:**

| Item | Amount | Indemnifiable? |
|---|---|---|
| Settled tax liability | $6.5M | Yes - Pre-Completion Tax Liability |
| Tax advisors' fees | $0.3M | Yes - "Reasonable costs" per indemnity clause |
| Legal fees | $0.2M | Yes - "Reasonable costs" |
| **Total Claim** | **$7.0M** | |

**Total Indemnity Claim: $7.0 million**

**Part 3: Limitations Analysis**

**Basket ($500,000 tipping basket):**
- Claim amount ($7.0M) **exceeds** basket threshold
- **Tipping basket**: Seller liable for **full $7.0M** (including amounts below basket)
- If basket were "deductible" type, Seller would pay $7.0M - $0.5M = $6.5M

**Cap ($30M, being 10% of purchase price):**
- Claim amount ($7.0M) is **below** the $30M cap
- **No reduction** due to cap

**Time Limit (6 years from Completion):**
- Completion: June 30, Year 1
- Assessment issued: Year 3 (within 6-year period)
- **Claim timely**

**Conclusion:** Claim is **fully covered** by indemnity (not limited by basket, cap, or time).

**Part 4: Recovery Position**

**Buyer's Recovery:**

```
Amount Owed by Seller:   $7.0M

Buyer's Out-of-Pocket:
- Settlement paid:        $6.5M
- Advisors' fees:         $0.3M
- Legal fees:             $0.2M
Total Spent:              $7.0M

Recovery from Seller:     $7.0M
Net Position:             $0 (fully reimbursed)
```

**Buyer is made whole** (recovers all amounts paid).

**Seller's Position:**
- Pays $7.0M indemnity
- **Plus** potential liability for breach of warranty damages (if Buyer can prove Target's value was impaired by the concealed audit risk)
- **Reputational damage** (future M&A transactions may include stricter representations)

**Negotiation Leverage:**
- Buyer could have demanded **price reduction** during transaction if audit risk had been disclosed
- Estimate: Disclosed audit risk might have reduced price by $5-10M (present value of potential liability)

**Part 5: Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payment**

**For Seller:**
- Indemnity payment is **not tax-deductible** (represents return of purchase price, not a business expense)
- Treated as **reduction of capital gain** on the original sale

**Revised Seller's Gain:**
```
Original sale proceeds:    $300.0M
Less: Indemnity paid:        -7.0M
Net proceeds:              $293.0M

If Seller's basis in shares was $200M:
Original gain:             $100.0M
Revised gain:               $93.0M (reduction of $7M)
```

**Seller may file amended tax return** to claim refund of capital gains tax overpaid (if still within amendment period).

**For Buyer:**
- Indemnity **received** is **not taxable income** (treated as reduction of purchase price)
- Buyer's basis in Target shares reduced from $300M to $293M

**However, the $6.5M tax liability paid is a deductible expense** for Target (if relating to deductible items like depreciation adjustments). Buyer gets a **second benefit**: indemnity reimbursement + Target's tax deduction for the underlying liability.

**Net Effect:**
- Buyer recovers $7.0M from Seller (non-taxable)
- Target deducts $6.5M tax paid (saves $6.5M × 21% = $1.37M in future tax)
- **Buyer's economic gain: $1.37M** (tax benefit on the indemnified liability)

Some SPAs include **"Tax Benefit Reduction" clauses** requiring Buyer to reimburse Seller for such tax benefits.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3: Earnout and Deferred Consideration Tax Treatment

**Facts:**

Buyer acquires Target Shale Oil Inc. from Seller with the following consideration structure:

**SPA Terms:**
- **Upfront Cash Payment**: $150 million (paid at Completion on January 1, Year 1)
- **Deferred Payment**: $50 million payable on December 31, Year 2 (no interest)
- **Contingent Earnout**: Additional payment based on Target's performance in Years 1-2:

```
Earnout Formula:
- If Average Annual Production > 10,000 boe/day: $30M
- If Average Annual Production 8,000-10,000 boe/day: $20M
- If Average Annual Production < 8,000 boe/day: $0
```

**Actual Performance:**
- Year 1 production: 9,500 boe/day
- Year 2 production: 10,500 boe/day
- **Average: 10,000 boe/day** → Earnout of **$30 million** triggered

**Tax Rates:**
- Seller's capital gains rate: **20%**
- Corporate tax rate: **21%**
- Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) for imputing interest: **4%**

**Required:**

1. Calculate **total consideration** and **Seller's capital gain**
2. Determine **timing of gain recognition** for Seller (installment sale rules)
3. Calculate **imputed interest** on deferred payment
4. Analyze **Buyer's tax basis** in Target shares
5. Explain **earnout tax treatment** for Buyer

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Total Consideration and Capital Gain**

**Total Consideration:**
```
Upfront cash:               $150M
Deferred payment (Year 2):   $50M
Earnout (Year 3):            $30M
--------------------------------------
Total Purchase Price:       $230M
```

Assume Seller's basis in Target shares: **$100M**

**Capital Gain:**
```
Total proceeds:             $230M
Less: Basis:               -$100M
Capital Gain:              $130M
```

**Part 2: Timing of Gain Recognition (Installment Sale Method)**

Under **IRC Section 453** (installment sale rules), Seller can defer gain recognition until payments are received.

**Gross Profit Percentage:**
```
Gross Profit % = Capital Gain ÷ Total Selling Price
               = $130M ÷ $230M
               = 56.52%
```

**Gain Recognized Each Year:**

| Year | Payment Received | Gross Profit % | Gain Recognized | Tax (20%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $150M (upfront) | 56.52% | $84.78M | $16.96M |
| Year 2 | $50M (deferred) | 56.52% | $28.26M | $5.65M |
| Year 3 | $30M (earnout) | 56.52% | $16.96M | $3.39M |
| **Total** | **$230M** | | **$130M** | **$26M** |

**Tax Benefit of Deferral:**

Instead of paying $26M tax in Year 1 (if all gain recognized immediately), Seller pays tax over 3 years:

| Year | Tax Paid | PV Factor (4%) | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $16.96M | 1.000 | $16.96M |
| 2 | $5.65M | 0.962 | $5.43M |
| 3 | $3.39M | 0.925 | $3.14M |
| **Total PV** | **$26M** | | **$25.53M** |

**Tax savings (PV): $26M - $25.53M = $0.47M** (time value benefit from deferral)

**Part 3: Imputed Interest on Deferred Payment**

The $50M deferred payment (Year 2) carries **no stated interest**. Under **IRC Section 1274**, Seller must impute interest at the **Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) = 4%**.

**OID (Original Issue Discount) Calculation:**
```
Present Value of Deferred Payment (at 4%) = $50M ÷ 1.04 = $48.08M

Imputed Interest (Year 2):
Face amount:                $50.00M
Less: PV:                  -$48.08M
OID/Imputed Interest:       $1.92M
```

**Revised Analysis:**

**Sale price allocation:**
- Upfront cash: $150M
- **PV of deferred payment: $48.08M** (not $50M)
- Earnout (Year 3, PV at Year 1): $30M ÷ 1.04² = $27.73M

**Revised Total Selling Price (PV basis): $225.81M**

**Seller's Tax Treatment:**
- **Capital gain** on $225.81M (recognized ratably under installment method)
- **Interest income** of $1.92M in Year 2 (ordinary income, taxed at ordinary rates)

**Part 4: Buyer's Tax Basis**

**Buyer's basis in Target shares:**

At Completion (Year 1):
```
Cash paid:                  $150.00M
Plus: PV of deferred payment: $48.08M
Plus: PV of earnout:         $27.73M (if reasonably estimable at closing)
Total Basis:                $225.81M
```

**Adjustment when payments made:**

Year 2 (Deferred payment):
- Additional basis: $50M - $48.08M = **$1.92M** (imputed interest component treated as additional purchase price)
- **Revised basis: $225.81M + $1.92M = $227.73M**

Year 3 (Earnout paid):
- Additional basis: $30M (actual payment)
- **Final basis: $227.73M + $30M = $257.73M**

Wait, this doesn't add up correctly. Let me recalculate:

Actually, for **earnout**, if the amount is **contingent and not reasonably estimable** at closing, Buyer does **not include it in initial basis**. Basis is increased **when earnout becomes fixed and determinable** (Year 3).

**Corrected Buyer's Basis:**

**Year 1 (Closing):**
```
Cash paid:                   $150.00M
Plus: PV of deferred payment: $48.08M
Plus: Earnout:                $0 (contingent, not included)
Initial Basis:               $198.08M
```

**Year 2:**
- Pay deferred $50M
- Increase basis by $1.92M (imputed interest = additional purchase price)
- **Basis: $198.08M + $1.92M = $200M**

**Year 3:**
- Pay earnout $30M
- Increase basis by $30M
- **Final Basis: $200M + $30M = $230M**

**Part 5: Earnout Tax Treatment for Buyer**

**Buyer's Perspective:**

The earnout payment **increases Buyer's basis** in Target shares when paid (Year 3). However, since this is a **stock purchase**, there is **no step-up in underlying asset basis**.

**If Buyer sells Target's stock in Year 4:**
- Basis for gain calculation: **$230M** (including earnout)
- If sold for $300M: Gain = $300M - $230M = $70M

**For Seller:**
- Earnout is **additional capital gain** recognized in Year 3
- Not treated as compensation or ordinary income (because it's tied to business performance, not Seller's services)

**Contingent Consideration Documentation:**

SPA should specify:
```
"The Earnout Payment, if any, shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes."
```

This ensures both parties treat it consistently (additional purchase price, not separate income/expense).

## 7. Conclusion

Sale and Purchase Agreements are the foundational legal documents governing M&A transactions, with profound tax implications. Key tax considerations:

1. **Purchase price allocation** determines depreciation, depletion, and goodwill amortization
2. **Tax warranties** allocate risk of unknown tax liabilities
3. **Tax indemnities** provide dollar-for-dollar protection for pre-closing tax claims
4. **Deferred and contingent consideration** triggers complex timing and characterization rules
5. **PSC assignments** require careful treatment of cost recovery balances and government approvals

Effective SPA drafting requires close collaboration between tax advisors, legal counsel, and commercial teams to optimize tax outcomes while managing transaction risk.

## Topic 31: Mergers and Acquisitions
### Carry-Forward Tax Losses

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Value of Tax Losses

**Carry-forward tax losses** (also called **tax loss carryforwards** or **net operating losses**) represent one of the most valuable hidden assets in oil and gas acquisitions. These losses, accumulated from:

- **Exploration expenditures** during pre-production phases
- **Dry holes** and unsuccessful drilling campaigns
- **Development costs** exceeding revenues in early production
- **Operating losses** during low commodity price cycles
- **Abandonment and decommissioning** costs

can offset **future taxable income**, potentially saving millions in tax payments. The present value of tax loss carryforwards can represent 15-30% of an acquisition target's value, particularly for companies transitioning from exploration to production.

### 1.2 Strategic Importance in M&A

From a buyer's perspective, acquiring a company with substantial tax losses offers:

- **Immediate tax shelter** for post-acquisition profits
- **Accelerated cash flow** recovery
- **Reduced effective tax rate** in consolidation
- **Enhanced after-tax returns** on investment

However, tax authorities impose **significant restrictions** on the use of acquired losses to prevent "trafficking in losses" - the practice of purchasing loss companies solely for tax benefits without genuine business purpose.

### 1.3 Key Questions in M&A Planning

Tax advisors must address:

- Are the target's losses **preserved** after change of ownership?
- What **continuity tests** and **anti-avoidance rules** apply?
- Can losses be used in **tax consolidation** with profitable entities?
- How do **PSC regimes** treat cost recovery balances in acquisitions?
- What **due diligence** is required to verify loss availability?

---

## 2. Types of Tax Losses and Carryforwards

### 2.1 Operating Losses

#### 2.1.1 Net Operating Losses (NOLs)

**Net Operating Losses** arise when tax-deductible expenses exceed taxable revenues in a given year. In oil and gas:

**Common sources:**
- **Intangible Drilling Costs (IDCs)** immediately expensed
- **Geological and geophysical (G&G) costs**
- **Lease acquisition costs** amortized over shorter periods
- **Depreciation** on production equipment
- **Operating expenses** during low production or low price periods

#### US Tax Treatment

- Pre-2018 losses: Can be carried back 2 years, forward 20 years
- Post-2017 losses (TCJA): **No carryback**, **indefinite carryforward**, limited to **80% of taxable income**
- **CARES Act (2020)**: Temporarily restored 5-year carryback for 2018-2020 losses

#### UK Tax Treatment

- Ring Fence Trade Losses: Can be carried forward indefinitely against future ring fence profits
- Non-trading losses: Special rules apply
- Group relief available for 75%+ groups

#### 2.1.2 Capital Losses

Capital losses arise from disposal of capital assets (shares, licenses, goodwill) at a loss. These typically:

- Can **only offset capital gains** (not ordinary income)
- Are less valuable in oil and gas M&A (most activity generates ordinary income)
- May have **shorter carryforward periods** (e.g., 5 years in some jurisdictions)

### 2.2 Cost Recovery Balances in PSC Regimes

Under **Production Sharing Contracts**, contractors accumulate **unrecovered costs** during exploration and development:

#### Cost Oil Carryforward

- Exploration costs not yet recovered via cost oil
- Development capex awaiting recovery
- Operating costs in excess of cost oil allowance

#### Treatment on Acquisition

- Cost balances typically **transfer with the PSC interest**
- New contractor "steps into shoes" of previous contractor
- Subject to **government approval** and PSC terms

#### Example - Indonesia

- Gross Split PSCs: No cost recovery mechanism (contractor receives fixed % of production)
- Cost Recovery PSCs: Unrecovered costs carry forward, subject to **cost oil ceiling** (typically 50-80% of production value)

#### Critical Due Diligence

- Verify cost pool balances with government audits
- Review any disputed costs or disallowances
- Confirm recovery provisions in PSC survive assignment

---

## 3. Change of Ownership Restrictions

### 3.1 Policy Rationale for Restrictions

Tax authorities impose **loss limitation rules** to prevent:

- **Loss trafficking**: Acquiring loss companies solely for tax benefits
- **Tax arbitrage**: Combining profitable and loss-making entities solely to reduce tax
- **Economic discontinuity**: Using losses from one business to shelter income from an unrelated business

#### 3.1.1 Continuity Principles

Most jurisdictions apply some form of **continuity test**:

- **Ownership continuity**: Substantial shareholding must remain constant
- **Business continuity**: Same trade or business must continue
- **Income continuity**: Losses offset only income from the same or similar activities

---

### 3.2 US Section 382 Limitations

#### 3.2.1 The Section 382 Framework

**US Internal Revenue Code Section 382** is the primary US rule restricting loss carryforwards after ownership changes.

**Ownership Change Definition:**
An **ownership change** occurs when:

- **50 percentage point increase** in ownership by **5% shareholders**
- Measured over a **3-year testing period**
- Applies to corporations only (not partnerships unless TEFRA election made)

**Example:**
- January 1, Year 1: Shareholder A owns 30%, Shareholder B owns 25%, Public owns 45%
- December 31, Year 3: Shareholder A owns 15% (decrease 15%), Shareholder C owns 40% (new 5% shareholder)
- **Ownership change**: 40% (Shareholder C increase) exceeds 50% threshold

#### 3.2.2 Annual Limitation Calculation

Once an ownership change occurs, the annual limitation on loss usage is:

**Formula:**
```
Annual Limitation = Fair Market Value of Company × Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate
```

**Where:**
- **FMV** = Fair market value of stock immediately before ownership change
- **Long-term tax-exempt rate** = IRS published rate (currently ~3-5%)

**Example:**
- Target Oil Co. has **$100 million NOLs**
- FMV immediately before acquisition: **$50 million**
- Long-term tax-exempt rate: **4%**
- **Annual limitation: $50M × 4% = $2 million per year**

Impact: Only **$2 million** of the $100 million NOLs can be used annually. At this rate, full utilization would take **50 years** (but losses are usable indefinitely post-TCJA).

**3.2.3 Built-In Gains and Losses (US Internal Revenue Code Section 382(h))**

If target has **unrealized built-in gains** (assets with FMV > tax basis), these gains **increase the annual limitation** if recognized within **5 years** after ownership change.

Conversely, **built-in losses** recognized within 5 years are **treated as NOLs** subject to the same limitation.

**Planning Opportunities:**
- Defer recognition of built-in losses
- Accelerate recognition of built-in gains to increase limitation
- Elect US Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10) to recognize all gains/losses immediately (with full tax cost)

**3.2.4 US Internal Revenue Code Section 382(l)(5) SRLY Limitation**

When a loss corporation joins a consolidated group, **Separate Return Limitation Year (SRLY)** rules may apply:

- Target's pre-acquisition losses can only offset its **own post-acquisition income** (not other group members' income)
- US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation applies **in addition to** SRLY rules
- Highly restrictive for loss companies acquired into profitable groups

### 3.3 UK Change of Ownership Rules

#### 3.3.1 Corporation Tax Act 2010, Part 14: Loss Restriction

UK rules disallow carried-forward losses if:

- There is a **change in ownership** of the company (>50% of shares), **and**
- There is a **major change in the nature or conduct** of the trade within **3 years** before or after the ownership change

**Major Change Indicators:**
- Change in type of property dealt in or services provided
- Change in customers, outlets, or markets
- Significant change in scale of activities

**Ring Fence Trade Exception:**
For oil and gas companies operating under **Ring Fence Corporation Tax**, losses from ring fence trade can generally be carried forward **even after ownership change**, provided:

- The **ring fence trade continues**
- Losses are used against **ring fence profits** only

#### 3.3.2 Group Relief

UK allows **group relief** for 75%+ groups:
- Current-year losses can be surrendered to profitable group members
- Does not consume carry-forward losses (those are preserved for target's own future income)

### 3.4 Other Jurisdictions

#### Australia - Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, Division 165-167
- **Continuity of Ownership Test (COT)**: >50% same ownership
- **Same Business Test (SBT)**: If COT fails, losses preserved if same business continues
- Strict application; many M&A transactions trigger loss denial

#### Canada - Income Tax Act, Section 111(5)
- **Acquisition of control** restrictions
- Losses restricted unless business continues and losses offset income from **same or similar** business
- Accrued losses on assets deemed realized on acquisition of control (limiting future deductions)

#### Norway

- No explicit change of ownership restrictions for petroleum tax losses
- Losses carried forward indefinitely against **same license income**

---

## 4. Preserving Tax Losses in Acquisitions

### 4.1 Structural Planning Techniques

#### 4.1.1 Avoid Triggering Ownership Change

Strategies to stay below Section 382 thresholds:

**Stock Purchase Below 50% Threshold:**
- Acquire **49.9% or less** of target
- Use **voting agreements** or **options** to control without ownership
- Structure as **joint venture** rather than acquisition

**Staged Acquisitions:**
- Spread share purchases over **more than 3 years**
- Reset the testing period between tranches
- Requires patience and assumes target remains available

#### 4.1.2 Increase Company Value Before Ownership Change

Since US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation = FMV × rate, increasing FMV increases annual limitation:

**Value Enhancement Strategies:**
- **Infuse capital** before ownership change (increases FMV)
- **Drill high-potential wells** to prove reserves (boosts valuation)
- **Complete development** projects to increase production (raises FMV)

**Example:**
- Company worth $50M → Annual limitation: $50M × 4% = $2M
- Inject $50M cash before change → Company worth $100M → Limitation: $4M (double)

However, injected capital must have **genuine business purpose** and not be solely to inflate the limitation (anti-abuse rules apply).

**4.1.3 US Internal Revenue Code Section 382(l)(5) Exception (Bankruptcy/Insolvency)**

If target is in **bankruptcy**, special rules under **US Internal Revenue Code Section 382(l)(5)** may apply:

- Shareholders and creditors receiving stock in bankruptcy are **excluded** from ownership change calculation
- Losses are **reduced by interest deductions** claimed during restructuring
- Allows preservation of most losses despite 100% ownership change

### 4.2 Business Continuity Planning

#### 4.2.1 Maintain Continuity of Trade

To avoid UK-style loss restrictions:

- **Continue operating** the same oil and gas assets
- Do not significantly alter the **business model** (e.g., switching from production to trading)
- Avoid **disposal of core assets** within 3 years of acquisition
- Maintain **customer base** and operational structure

#### 4.2.2 Segregate Business Lines

If acquiring a target with **multiple business lines** (e.g., upstream and midstream):

- Consider **holding each in separate subsidiaries**
- Losses from discontinued businesses will be lost, but losses from continuing businesses preserved
- Allows surgical divestitures without jeopardizing all losses

---

## 5. Utilizing Losses Post-Acquisition

### 5.1 Tax Consolidation Strategies

#### 5.1.1 Consolidated Return Filing (US)

80%+ affiliated groups can file **consolidated returns**, pooling income and losses:

**Benefits:**
- **Offset** one member's income with another's losses
- **Intercompany transactions** eliminated (no tax on intra-group sales)
- **Simplified compliance** (single tax return)

**Limitations:**
- **US Internal Revenue Code Section 382** limits remain (target's losses limited annually)
- **SRLY rules** may prevent use of target's pre-acquisition losses against other members' income
- **Consolidated return election** is binding for all future years

#### 5.1.2 Group Relief (UK)

75%+ groups can **surrender current-year losses** to profitable members:

- Does **not consume** carry-forward losses (target keeps its carryforwards for own future profit)
- Requires **group relief claim** filed within time limits
- Both companies must be **UK resident** or within qualifying group structure

### 5.2 Timing of Income Recognition

#### 5.2.1 Accelerate Income into Loss Company

Where possible, structure transactions to **accelerate income** into the loss company:

- **Transfer producing assets** into loss company (generates income to absorb losses)
- **License technology or IP** to group members, with royalties paid to loss company
- **Provide services** on behalf of group, invoicing at arm's length prices

#### 5.2.2 Defer Income Out of Loss Company

Conversely, if annual limitation (US Internal Revenue Code Section 382) is low, consider:

- **Deferring income** to future years when limitation may increase
- **Using installment sales** to spread gain recognition
- **Capitalizing costs** rather than immediately expensing

---

## 6. PSC Cost Recovery and Unrecovered Costs

### 6.1 Transfer of Cost Recovery Balances

#### 6.1.1 Contractor's Rights on Assignment

When a PSC interest is sold:

- **Unrecovered costs** accumulated by the seller generally **transfer to the buyer**
- Buyer "steps into the shoes" of the seller for cost recovery purposes
- Subject to **government approval** and **assignment provisions** in PSC

**Key Provisions to Review:**
- **Assignment clause**: Does PSC permit assignment? Government consent required?
- **Cost carry rights**: Are unrecovered costs explicitly assignable?
- **Audit contingencies**: Are there disputed costs that may be disallowed?

#### 6.1.2 Government Consent and Audits

Host governments typically:

- **Audit cost pools** before approving assignment
- **Disallow** any non-compliant costs (non-arm's length, non-recoverable items)
- May require **settlement of disputes** before transfer

**Due Diligence Checklist:**
- Obtain **final audited cost statements** from government
- Review **cost disallowance history**
- Verify **currency** of cost pool balances
- Confirm **no disputes** pending

### 6.2 Valuation of Cost Recovery Balances

**Unrecovered costs** are valuable because they:

- Reduce **taxable income** (by allowing higher cost oil allocation)
- Accelerate **cash flow** (more oil retained by contractor sooner)

**Valuation Methodology:**
```
PV of Cost Recovery = (Unrecovered Cost Pool) × (Contractor's Tax Rate) × (Present Value Factor)
```

**Example:**
- Unrecovered costs: **$100 million**
- Expected recovery period: **5 years**
- Contractor's tax rate: **30%**
- Discount rate: **10%**

If costs are recovered evenly over 5 years ($20M/year):

| Year | Cost Recovery | Tax Savings (30%) | PV Factor | PV of Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $20M | $6M | 0.909 | $5.45M |
| 2 | $20M | $6M | 0.826 | $4.96M |
| 3 | $20M | $6M | 0.751 | $4.51M |
| 4 | $20M | $6M | 0.683 | $4.10M |
| 5 | $20M | $6M | 0.621 | $3.73M |
| **Total** | **$100M** | **$30M** | | **$22.75M** |

**Present value of cost recovery benefit: $22.75 million**

## 7. Worked Examples

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1: Section 382 Limitation and Loss Utilization

**Facts:**

Buyer Corp acquires 100% of Target Oil Inc. on **January 1, Year 1** for **$80 million** cash. Target has:

- **Net Operating Losses (NOLs): $150 million**
- **Fair market value** immediately before acquisition: **$80 million**
- **Long-term tax-exempt rate: 4%**
- Target operates a mature oil field generating **$25 million taxable income per year** (before NOL deductions)

Corporate tax rate: **21%**

Target has **built-in gains** of **$30 million** on appreciated production equipment, which will be **recognized in Year 2** through sale or depreciation acceleration.

**Required:**

1. Determine if a **US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 ownership change** occurred
2. Calculate the **annual US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation**
3. Calculate **NOL utilization** for Years 1-5, considering built-in gains
4. Determine **cumulative tax savings** over 5 years (PV at 10%)

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Ownership Change Determination**

Buyer Corp acquired **100%** of Target's stock. This represents a **100 percentage point increase** in ownership by a 5% shareholder (Buyer Corp), which **exceeds the 50% threshold**.

**Conclusion: US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 ownership change occurred** on January 1, Year 1.

**Part 2: Annual US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 Limitation**

**Base Annual Limitation:**
```
Annual Limitation = FMV × Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate
                  = $80M × 4%
                  = $3.2 million per year
```

**Built-In Gains Adjustment (Year 2):**

In Year 2, Target recognizes **$30 million built-in gain**. Under **US Internal Revenue Code Section 382(h)(1)(A)(i)**, recognized built-in gains **increase the US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation** in the year recognized.

**Adjusted Limitation (Year 2 only):**
```
Year 2 Limitation = $3.2M (base) + $30M (built-in gain recognized)
                  = $33.2 million
```

Years 1, 3-5: **$3.2 million per year**

**Part 3: NOL Utilization (Years 1-5)**

**Year 1:**
- Taxable income before NOL: **$25M**
- US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation: **$3.2M**
- **NOL deduction allowed: $3.2M** (lesser of $25M income or $3.2M limitation)
- **Taxable income after NOL: $25M - $3.2M = $21.8M**
- NOLs remaining: $150M - $3.2M = **$146.8M**

**Year 2:**
- Taxable income before NOL: $25M + $30M built-in gain = **$55M**
- US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation: **$33.2M** (base $3.2M + built-in gain $30M)
- **NOL deduction allowed: $33.2M**
- **Taxable income after NOL: $55M - $33.2M = $21.8M**
- NOLs remaining: $146.8M - $33.2M = **$113.6M**

**Year 3:**
- Taxable income before NOL: **$25M**
- US Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation: **$3.2M**
- **NOL deduction allowed: $3.2M**
- **Taxable income after NOL: $21.8M**
- NOLs remaining: $113.6M - $3.2M = **$110.4M**

**Year 4:**
- Same as Year 3
- **NOL deduction: $3.2M**
- **Taxable income after NOL: $21.8M**
- NOLs remaining: $110.4M - $3.2M = **$107.2M**

**Year 5:**
- Same as Years 3-4
- **NOL deduction: $3.2M**
- **Taxable income after NOL: $21.8M**
- NOLs remaining: $107.2M - $3.2M = **$104M**

**Summary:**

| Year | Income Before NOL | IRC §382 Limit | NOL Used | Taxable Income | Tax (21%) | NOL Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $25.0M | $3.2M | $3.2M | $21.8M | $4.58M | $146.8M |
| 2 | $55.0M | $33.2M | $33.2M | $21.8M | $4.58M | $113.6M |
| 3 | $25.0M | $3.2M | $3.2M | $21.8M | $4.58M | $110.4M |
| 4 | $25.0M | $3.2M | $3.2M | $21.8M | $4.58M | $107.2M |
| 5 | $25.0M | $3.2M | $3.2M | $21.8M | $4.58M | $104.0M |
| **Total** | | | **$46M** | | **$22.9M** | |

**Part 4: Tax Savings and Present Value**

**Tax savings from NOL deductions:**

| Year | NOL Used | Tax Saved (21%) | PV Factor (10%) | PV of Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3.2M | $0.67M | 0.909 | $0.61M |
| 2 | $33.2M | $6.97M | 0.826 | $5.76M |
| 3 | $3.2M | $0.67M | 0.751 | $0.50M |
| 4 | $3.2M | $0.67M | 0.683 | $0.46M |
| 5 | $3.2M | $0.67M | 0.621 | $0.42M |
| **Total** | **$46M** | **$9.65M** | | **$7.75M** |

**Present value of tax savings over 5 years: $7.75 million**

**Observations:**

1. **Only $46M** of $150M NOLs used in first 5 years (30.7%)
2. **Built-in gain recognition** in Year 2 accelerates NOL usage significantly (captures $30M vs usual $3.2M)
3. At this rate, full NOL utilization would take **~41 years**: ($150M - $30M from Year 2) ÷ $3.2M/year ≈ 38 years + 2 years = 40 years
4. However, NOLs are now **indefinite carryforward** (post-TCJA), so no expiration risk

**Planning Recommendations:**
- **Accelerate more built-in gains** into first 5 years to utilize more NOLs
- Consider **US Internal Revenue Code Section 338(g)** election to step up basis (though triggers immediate tax)
- **Increase income** at Target through intercompany transactions to absorb NOLs faster

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2: PSC Cost Recovery Balances in Acquisition

**Facts:**

Buyer Energy is acquiring a **30% participating interest** in an Indonesian PSC from Seller Oil Co. Purchase price: **$120 million**.

**PSC Terms:**
- Cost recovery ceiling: **70% of gross revenue**
- Profit oil split: 40% Contractor / 60% Government
- Corporate tax: 44% (paid by Government from its profit oil share)
  - *Note: This reflects historical PSC rates; current Indonesian PSCs typically have a 25% corporate tax rate following Law No. 6 of 2023, which reduced the general rate from 25% to 22%. This example uses 44% for illustrative purposes representing older PSC contracts.*

**Seller's Unrecovered Cost Pool (30% interest basis):**
- Exploration costs: **$40 million**
- Development costs: **$80 million**
- **Total unrecovered costs: $120 million**

**Field Production Forecast (100% basis):**

| Year | Production (MMbbl) | Oil Price ($/bbl) | Gross Revenue | Operating Costs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5.0 | $70 | $350M | $100M |
| 2 | 6.0 | $70 | $420M | $120M |
| 3 | 6.0 | $70 | $420M | $120M |

Buyer's 30% share of production, revenue, and costs.

**Required:**

1. Calculate **annual cost oil recovery** from Seller's unrecovered cost pool
2. Determine **contractor's profit oil** and **government's share**
3. Calculate **contractor's net cash flow** (after tax, paid by Government)
4. Determine **present value** of cost recovery benefit (discount rate 12%)

**Analysis:**

**Part 1: Annual Cost Oil Recovery (30% Interest)**

**Year 1:**

Buyer's 30% share:
- Gross revenue: $350M × 30% = **$105M**
- Operating costs (Year 1): $100M × 30% = **$30M**
- Cost recovery ceiling: $105M × 70% = **$73.5M**

**Cost Oil Allocation:**
- Operating costs recovered first: **$30M**
- Remaining cost oil capacity: $73.5M - $30M = **$43.5M**
- Capex recovery: **$43.5M** (from $120M unrecovered pool)

**Total cost oil recovered (Year 1): $30M (opex) + $43.5M (capex) = $73.5M**

**Unrecovered cost pool end of Year 1: $120M - $43.5M = $76.5M**

**Year 2:**

Buyer's 30% share:
- Gross revenue: $420M × 30% = **$126M**
- Operating costs: $120M × 30% = **$36M**
- Cost recovery ceiling: $126M × 70% = **$88.2M**

**Cost Oil Allocation:**
- Operating costs: **$36M**
- Remaining capacity: $88.2M - $36M = **$52.2M**
- Capex recovery: **$52.2M** (from $76.5M pool)

**Total cost oil recovered (Year 2): $36M + $52.2M = $88.2M**

**Unrecovered cost pool end of Year 2: $76.5M - $52.2M = $24.3M**

**Year 3:**

Buyer's 30% share:
- Gross revenue: **$126M**
- Operating costs: **$36M**
- Cost recovery ceiling: **$88.2M**

**Cost Oil Allocation:**
- Operating costs: **$36M**
- Remaining capacity: $88.2M - $36M = **$52.2M**
- Capex recovery: **$24.3M** (remaining pool exhausted)

**Total cost oil recovered (Year 3): $36M + $24.3M = $60.3M**

**Unrecovered cost pool end of Year 3: $0**

**Part 2: Profit Oil and Government Share**

**Year 1:**

- Gross revenue (30% share): **$105M**
- Less: Cost oil: **($73.5M)**
- **Profit oil: $31.5M**

Split:
- Contractor (40%): $31.5M × 40% = **$12.6M**
- Government (60%): $31.5M × 60% = **$18.9M**

**Tax (44% paid by Government from its share):**
- Contractor's taxable income: Cost oil + Profit oil share = $73.5M + $12.6M = $86.1M
- Tax due: $86.1M × 44% = $37.88M
- **Government pays tax** from its profit oil share

Contractor's net cash receipt:
- Cost oil: **$73.5M**
- Profit oil: **$12.6M**
- **Total (before tax): $86.1M**
- Less: Tax (paid by Government, no cash impact on Contractor)
- **Net cash to Contractor: $86.1M**

Wait, in Indonesian PSCs, the **Government pays the corporate tax** from its share, so contractor receives full cost oil + profit oil share without deduction.

**Year 2:**

- Gross revenue: **$126M**
- Cost oil: **$88.2M**
- **Profit oil: $37.8M**

Split:
- Contractor: $37.8M × 40% = **$15.12M**
- Government: $37.8M × 60% = **$22.68M**

**Contractor's net cash: $88.2M (cost oil) + $15.12M (profit oil) = $103.32M**

**Year 3:**

- Gross revenue: **$126M**
- Cost oil: **$60.3M**
- **Profit oil: $65.7M**

Split:
- Contractor: $65.7M × 40% = **$26.28M**
- Government: $65.7M × 60% = **$39.42M**

**Contractor's net cash: $60.3M + $26.28M = $86.58M**

**Part 3: Summary and Present Value**

| Year | Cost Oil | Profit Oil (40%) | Total Cash to Contractor | PV Factor (12%) | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $73.5M | $12.6M | $86.1M | 0.893 | $76.9M |
| 2 | $88.2M | $15.12M | $103.32M | 0.797 | $82.3M |
| 3 | $60.3M | $26.28M | $86.58M | 0.712 | $61.6M |
| **Total** | **$222M** | **$54M** | **$276M** | | **$220.8M** |

**Present Value of Cash Flows: $220.8 million**

**Value of Cost Recovery Benefit:**

The cost recovery balance of $120M allows the contractor to:
- **Recover $120M** of prior costs over 3 years (accelerated)
- Reduces taxable profit oil (more revenue treated as cost oil)
- **Tax impact**: $120M costs reduce profit oil, saving approximately $120M × 44% tax = **$52.8M** in tax (paid by Government)

However, since Government pays tax, the contractor **still receives** $73.5M + $88.2M + $24.3M = **$186M in cost oil**, which would have been **partially taxable** as profit oil without the cost pool.

The **incremental value** of having the $120M cost pool is that it **accelerates cash recovery** by treating production revenue as cost recovery rather than profit subject to 60/40 split.

**Conclusion:**

The PSC cost recovery balance of **$120 million** is fully recovered over **3 years**, accelerating the contractor's cash flow. The present value benefit is approximately **$35-40 million**, representing the time value of money from earlier cost recovery versus waiting longer if costs had to be recovered from future profit oil splits.

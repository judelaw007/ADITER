# 40. Leasing and Tax Treaties

## Introduction

The treatment of lease payments under double tax treaties is critical for determining **withholding tax obligations** and **source country taxing rights**. The fundamental question is whether lease payments constitute **royalties (Article 12)**, which allows source country withholding tax, or **business profits (Article 7)**, which generally requires a permanent establishment for source taxation.

The divergence between the **OECD Model** (which removed equipment leasing from Article 12 in 1992) and the **UN Model** (which retains equipment leasing as royalties) creates significant complexity for multinational oil and gas companies leasing equipment across borders.

---

## 1. Historical Evolution of Treaty Treatment

### 1.1 Pre-1992 OECD Model

Before 1992, **Article 12(3)** of the OECD Model included:

> "...payments for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific **equipment**."

**Impact**: Equipment rental was treated as a **royalty**, allowing source countries to impose withholding tax (typically 5-15% under negotiated treaty rates).

### 1.2 1992 OECD Amendment

In 1992, the OECD **deleted** the equipment leasing provision from Article 12, based on the rationale that:

- Equipment leasing is an **active business** activity, not passive income
- Differs fundamentally from **know-how licensing** or IP royalties
- Should be treated as **business profits (Article 7)**, taxable only if a PE exists

**Result**: Under post-1992 OECD Model treaties, equipment rental payments are:
- **Not subject to withholding tax** (unless the treaty explicitly provides otherwise)
- Taxable **only in the lessor's residence country** (unless the lessor has a PE in the source country)

### 1.3 UN Model Retains Equipment Leasing

The **UN Model** continues to include equipment leasing in Article 12(3):

> "...payments...for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment..."

**Rationale**: Source countries (typically capital-importing developing countries) seek to retain taxing rights over significant equipment rental flows, particularly in capital-intensive sectors like oil and gas.

## 2. Key Treaty Classification Issues

### 2.1 Equipment Rental vs. Services

**Issue**: When a lessor provides not only equipment but also **operational services** (e.g., crewed drilling rig, operated FPSO), is the payment for equipment (royalty) or services (business profits)?

**OECD Commentary Guidance**:

- If the **predominant character** is the **provision of equipment**, treat as royalty (if treaty includes equipment in Article 12)
- If the **predominant character** is **human expertise and services**, treat as business profits (Article 7)

**Example**:

- **Bare boat charter** (rig only, no crew): Equipment rental
- **Operated rig** (rig + crew + drilling services): Primarily services → Article 7

### 2.2 Lease vs. Sale (Finance Lease)

**Issue**: If a "lease" is economically a **disguised sale** (finance lease with transfer of ownership), is the payment rent or installment purchase price?

**Treaty Treatment**:

- **True lease** (lessor retains substantial risks and rewards): Royalty (if equipment in Article 12) or business profits
- **Finance lease** (lessee obtains substantially all benefits and risks): Treated as **sale** followed by debt payments
  - Purchase price: Capital transaction (no WHT under most treaties)
  - Interest component: Article 11 (Interest), subject to WHT per treaty rate

**Indicators of Finance Lease**:

- Transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at lease end
- Lease term covers major part of asset's useful life (≥75%)
- Present value of payments approximates asset's fair value (≥90%)

### 2.3 Immovable Property vs. Equipment

**Article 6 (Income from Immovable Property)**: Source country has **full taxing rights** over income from immovable property, regardless of PE.

**Issue**: Are **fixed installations** (offshore platforms, refineries, pipelines) immovable property or equipment?

**OECD Commentary**:

- Property is **immovable** if it cannot be moved without destruction or substantial damage
- **Offshore platforms**: Generally treated as **movable** (can be towed to different locations), thus equipment
- **Pipelines**: Generally treated as **immovable** property

**Example**: Rental of a **fixed offshore production platform** may be treated as income from immovable property (Article 6), allowing full source country taxation.

## 3. Practical Treaty Analysis

### 3.1 Treaty-by-Treaty Approach Required

**Step 1**: Identify the **specific bilateral treaty** between lessor's residence country and source country

**Step 2**: Examine **Article 12** to determine if equipment leasing is included:

- **If equipment included**: Payment is a royalty, subject to treaty WHT rate (typically 5-15%)
- **If equipment excluded**: Payment falls under Article 7 (Business Profits)

**Step 3**: If Article 7 applies, assess whether lessor has a **PE** in source country:

- **No PE**: Source country cannot tax (exclusive residence taxation)
- **PE exists**: Source country taxes **net profit attributable to PE**

### 3.2 Common Treaty Positions

| Lessor Country | Source Country | Equipment in Article 12? | WHT Rate (if applicable) |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Norway** | Angola | Yes (UN Model-based) | 10% |
| **Norway** | UK | No (OECD Model-based) | 0% |
| **U.S.** | UK | No (post-1992 OECD) | 0% |
| **U.S.** | Nigeria | Yes (older treaty) | 7.5% |
| **Singapore** | Brazil | Yes (UN Model influence) | 15% |
| **Netherlands** | Indonesia | Yes | 10% |

## 4. Interaction with Domestic Law

### 4.1 Treaty Override of Domestic WHT

**General Rule**: Treaties **reduce or eliminate** domestic withholding tax rates, but do not **increase** them.

**Example**:

- **Angola domestic law**: 10% WHT on equipment rental
- **Angola-Norway treaty**: 10% WHT on royalties (equipment included)
- **Result**: Treaty rate applies (10%)

**Example 2**:

- **UK domestic law**: No WHT on equipment rental
- **UK-Norway treaty**: Equipment excluded from Article 12
- **Result**: 0% WHT (domestic law already favorable; treaty confirms)

### 4.2 Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clauses

Some treaties include **MFN clauses** providing that if the source country grants more favorable treatment to a third country, the favorable treatment automatically extends to the treaty partner.

**Example**:

- **Country A-Source Country treaty**: 10% WHT on equipment rental
- **MFN clause** in treaty
- **Country B-Source Country treaty** (negotiated later): 5% WHT on equipment rental
- **Result**: Country A lessor may claim **5% rate** under MFN clause

## 5. Beneficial Ownership and Treaty Shopping

### 5.1 Beneficial Ownership Requirement

To claim treaty benefits, the lessor must be the **beneficial owner** of the rental income, not merely a conduit or agent.

**OECD Commentary**: Beneficial owner is the person who has **full right to use and enjoy** the income and is not obligated to pass it on to another person.

**Example - Treaty Shopping Denied**:

A U.S. drilling contractor establishes a **Netherlands subsidiary** to own drilling rigs and lease them to operating entities worldwide. The Netherlands subsidiary:

- Has no employees (all management in U.S.)
- Immediately pays all rental income to U.S. parent as "management fees"
- Has no decision-making authority

**Result**: Netherlands subsidiary is **not the beneficial owner**. Treaty benefits may be **denied**, and source countries may impose full domestic WHT.

### 5.2 Limitation on Benefits

Many U.S. treaties include **Limitation on Benefits (LOB) provisions** requiring that the treaty claimant:

- Is a **qualified person** (meets ownership and base erosion tests), OR
- Engages in **active trade or business** related to the income

**Application to Leasing**:

A Cayman Islands company establishing a Netherlands subsidiary solely to benefit from favorable Netherlands treaty rates may fail the LOB test if it:

- Is not a qualified person (owned by Cayman parent, not Netherlands residents)
- Is not engaged in active business in Netherlands (no substance)

## WORKED EXAMPLE: Multi-Jurisdiction Lease Structure and Treaty Optimization

### Facts

**GlobalDrill Corporation**, a U.S.-based drilling contractor, owns 5 ultra-deepwater drillships valued at **$2.5 billion** ($ 500 million each). The company leases these drillships to operators in multiple jurisdictions:

| Lease | Operator | Operator Country | Annual Lease Payment |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Drillship A | North Sea Operator | Norway | $80 million |
| Drillship B | West Africa Operator | Angola | $75 million |
| Drillship C | South America Operator | Brazil | $70 million |
| Drillship D | Southeast Asia Operator | Indonesia | $75 million |
| Drillship E | Gulf of Mexico Operator | U.S. | $80 million |

**Total Annual Rental Income**: $380 million

**Current Structure**: All drillships owned by **GlobalDrill Corporation (U.S.)**, which directly leases to operators.

**Withholding Tax Rates** (on equipment rental to U.S. lessor):

| Country | Domestic WHT | Treaty WHT (U.S. Treaty) | Equipment in Article 12? |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Norway | 0% | 0% | No (post-1992 OECD) |
| Angola | 10% | 10% | Yes (UN Model-based) |
| Brazil | 15% | 15% | Yes |
| Indonesia | 20% | 10% | Yes |
| U.S. | N/A | N/A | Domestic income |

**Proposed Restructuring**: Establish a **Netherlands B.V. leasing subsidiary** to own the drillships and lease them to operators. Netherlands has favorable treaty rates with many countries.

**Netherlands Treaty WHT Rates**:

| Country | Netherlands Treaty WHT on Equipment Rental |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| Norway | 0% (equipment excluded from Article 12) |
| Angola | 10% (same as U.S. treaty) |
| Brazil | 15% (same as U.S. treaty) |
| Indonesia | 5% (favorable rate) |

### Required

1. Calculate **total withholding taxes** under current U.S. ownership structure
2. Calculate **total withholding taxes** under proposed Netherlands structure
3. Assess **substance requirements** for Netherlands subsidiary to claim treaty benefits
4. Evaluate whether the restructuring is economically justified

### Analysis

**Step 1: Current Structure - U.S. Ownership**

**Withholding Taxes by Country**:

```
Norway: $80M × 0% = $0
Angola: $75M × 10% = $7.5M
Brazil: $70M × 15% = $10.5M
Indonesia: $75M × 10% = $7.5M
U.S.: $80M × 0% (domestic) = $0

Total WHT = $25.5 million
```

**U.S. Tax Calculation**:

```
Gross rental income = $380M
Less: Operating expenses (maintenance, crew, insurance) = $80M
Less: Depreciation (5 drillships, $500M each, 7-year MACRS) = Assume $180M
Taxable income = $120M

U.S. tax at 21% = $25.2M
Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) - WHT paid = $25.5M (exceeds U.S. tax, so fully creditable)
Net U.S. tax = $0

Total Group Tax = $25.5M (all foreign WHT)
Effective Rate = 6.7% on gross income
```

**Step 2: Proposed Structure - Netherlands Ownership**

**Withholding Taxes by Country**:

```
Norway: $80M × 0% = $0
Angola: $75M × 10% = $7.5M
Brazil: $70M × 15% = $10.5M
Indonesia: $75M × 5% = $3.75M (savings vs. U.S. treaty)
U.S.: $80M × 0% = $0

Total WHT = $21.75 million (savings of $3.75M vs. U.S. structure)
```

**Netherlands Tax**:

```
Gross rental income = $380M
Less: WHT = $21.75M
Net income = $358.25M
Less: Operating expenses = $80M
Less: Depreciation = $180M
Taxable income = $98.25M

Netherlands corporate tax at 25.8% = $25.35M
```

**Dividend to U.S. Parent**:

```
After-tax income = $98.25M - $25.35M = $72.9M
Netherlands WHT on dividends to U.S. = 0% (treaty exemption for 10%+ ownership)
```

**U.S. Tax (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) Inclusion)**:

```
Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) net income = $72.9M
Less: 10% × Qualified Business Asset Investment (QBAI) (tangible assets: assume $2.5B drillships) = $250M
GILTI = MAX(0, $72.9M - $250M) = $0 (negative, no GILTI inclusion)
```

**Note**: The large QBAI deduction (drillships are tangible assets) **eliminates GILTI tax**.

**Total Group Tax (Netherlands Structure)**:

```
Foreign WHT = $21.75M
Netherlands tax = $25.35M
U.S. tax = $0
Total = $47.1M
Effective Rate = 12.4% on gross income
```

**Step 3: Comparison**

| Structure | Total Annual Tax | Effective Rate |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **U.S. ownership** | $25.5M | 6.7% |
| **Netherlands ownership** | $47.1M | 12.4% |
| **Additional cost** | **+$21.6M** | **+5.7%** |

**Conclusion**: The Netherlands structure **increases** total tax by $21.6 million annually!

**Why?**

- **WHT savings**: Only $3.75M (Indonesia rate reduction from 10% to 5%)
- **Netherlands corporate tax**: Additional $25.35M (25.8% on net income)
- **U.S. Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)**: Under current structure, U.S. tax is fully offset by FTC; Netherlands structure adds Netherlands tax that is not fully creditable

**Step 4: Substance Requirements**

For Netherlands B.V. to claim treaty benefits, it must:

- Have **qualified employees** (minimum 2-3 FTEs) with leasing expertise
- Maintain **adequate office space** in Netherlands
- Make **key decisions** in Netherlands (board meetings, lease negotiations)
- Incur **adequate operating expenses** (salaries, rent, professional fees)

**Estimated Substance Costs**: $1-2 million per year

**Step 5: Recommendation**

**Do NOT restructure** through Netherlands B.V. because:

1. **Increased tax cost**: $21.6M per year additional tax
2. **Limited WHT savings**: Only $3.75M savings on Indonesia leases
3. **Substance costs**: Additional $1-2M per year for compliance
4. **Complexity**: Increased transfer pricing documentation, Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR), administrative burden

**Alternative Approach**:

If seeking to reduce Indonesia WHT, consider establishing a **Singapore leasing subsidiary** for the Indonesia lease only:

- **Singapore-Indonesia treaty**: 5% WHT on equipment rental (same as Netherlands)
- **Singapore corporate tax**: 17% (lower than Netherlands 25.8%)
- **Potential GILTI exposure**: But with large tangible assets (drillships), QBAI deduction likely eliminates GILTI

**Selective Restructuring Analysis** (Singapore for Indonesia lease only):

```
Indonesia WHT savings: ($75M × 10%) - ($75M × 5%) = $3.75M
Singapore tax: Taxable income ~$40M × 17% = $6.8M
U.S. GILTI: Eliminated by QBAI

Additional annual tax: ~$3M
But substance requirements simpler for single-asset structure
```

**Conclusion**: Even selective restructuring is not attractive given the modest WHT savings and additional corporate tax/compliance costs. **Maintain U.S. ownership** of all drillships.

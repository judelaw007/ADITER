Slide: Core Framework and Statutory Basis

International investment in the energy resources sector involves cross-border capital flows directed toward exploration, development, production, and distribution of petroleum, natural gas, and renewable energy assets. The tax treatment of such investments is governed by domestic legislation, bilateral tax treaties, and international standards from the OECD and UN. Here's the thing with statutory foundation.  The primary legislative framework comprises: Domestic corporate income tax laws: Each jurisdiction taxes profits from operations within its borders Capital gains tax provisions: Treatment of gains on disposal of energy assets or shares Withholding tax regimes: Taxation at source on dividends, interest, and royalties

Anti-avoidance legislation: CFC rules, transfer pricing regulations, and GAAR Tax treaty networks: Over 3,000 bilateral treaties govern allocation of taxing rights The OECD Model Tax Convention (updated 2017, amended via MLI) provides the template for bilateral treaties, establishing principles for residence and source taxation, permanent establishment thresholds, and relief from double taxation. So when we talk about fundamental principles,  Source vs. Residence Taxation: Source jurisdiction (where resources are located) claims primary taxing rights over extraction income, while residence jurisdiction (where investor is tax resident) may tax worldwide income subject to foreign tax relief. Permanent Establishment (PE): Under treaties, business profits are taxable only in residence state unless investor has a PE in source state. Energy sector activities often create PE through production platforms, extended operations, or construction activities exceeding treaty thresholds (typically 6-12 months).

Arm's Length Principle: Cross-border related-party transactions must be priced as if between independent parties (OECD Model Article 9, domestic transfer pricing legislation).

This is particularly important when considering the broader tax implications.
